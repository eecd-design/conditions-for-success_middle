00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
This was.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.300
Okay.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.266
I'm telling you.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.400
Okay. Damn!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.333
This is not what I would be after.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.066
Not waste of time.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.100
Why are you just this week with your arm?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.766
Poor Laura.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.766
I'm telling you, it's not serious.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Oh, I'm looking for someone
who can show us,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.900
their work and their thinking of how
they would add 1 in 1.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
Six plus one and one third.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:53.866
Anybody can.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.233
Ariana. One.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:59.233
Two. Eight.

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:05.966
Eight.

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:06.500
Six. Eight.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.333
Who can tell me what?

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.600
1 in 1 sixth
plus one and one third equals.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
One and two.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Eight.

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.666
Is there a way that we could.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700
Does anyone have anything different?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.900
Okay. We are doing this. Thank you.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.800
Good job.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800
Yeah, I will be doing.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.500
My, And for you.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.133
See? A lot longer.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
We'll.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:51.266
Add. And we're giving

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.833
it up to two different programs,
all with it.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Okay, so our goal is to find.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.500
This everyone.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.433
And if I see, I see one,
two with their hands and not shouting out

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:12.433
they're not calling young people. But.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.133
Hey, y'all,
can you tell your friends to move?

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:24.400
Every day you walk in my locker
and I keep getting.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.833
I'm going to be late to class
because of you guys.

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:27.666
Oh my God.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.200
We're allowed here.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.700
Are my friends
allowed to stand wherever they want?

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.500
Yeah, they could stand,
but I organize right

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.566
there, and I need to get to where
I want to go, where I want, what I want.

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:40.133
If you don't treat me,
I'm going to be late to class.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:41.900
Because if you got, then be honest.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.300
It's every day you.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.733
Yeah.

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:49.600
And then

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.366
they got me.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.366
To like,

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:57.366
I feel like today,
especially on other days,

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.800
you and your friends are in my locker,
and, like, I don't mean to like, bother

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.933
you guys, but it does bother you
because I'm really close to getting

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:09.100
another dispensary, and it's hard
to get to my after we get you.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:09.966
So that's okay.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.866
I'll talk to my friends. I'm
really sorry I didn't notice, so I got.
