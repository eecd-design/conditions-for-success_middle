00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.710
Everyone feels
nervous in their first day of school.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.379
I mean, who doesn't really?

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.148
Personally,
I was very nervous when I came here.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.684
But that's
what the Welcome Committee is for.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.055
So we want to help newcomers
to be welcomed in the school,

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.960
to help them relieve their stress of being
in an unknown and new environment.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.630
And you want to show newcomers
that they belong in the school,

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.334
and that they can be what they are
or who they are.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.837
So our policy as the welcoming

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.840
Committee Club is to welcome students,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:45.412
and have them get accustomed
to the new school, to the new environment.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.347
We feature curiosity.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.448
We guide them.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:52.419
And also we we make them feel safe
and make them feel

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:56.623
accepted in this
new school and make them feel

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.091
they are.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.526
They belong to this school.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.028
They they have what to say.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.398
And also they have the freedom
to participate in the activities.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.733
The one in the school.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.403
On the first school day
we welcome them right at the door.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.642
We just gave you a big smile
and a little welcome back

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.444
after that.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.212
Like we bring them to the yellow car.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.081
Like you should have a question
to the local,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.983
teach them how to open their locker.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:28.054
Unlike most straight to the door,
bring that to each class like

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.357
and present them to a student
they can be friends with.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:35.261
Like me, they presented me to once the
who was student and it's me student.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.264
Our leader of the community
got a community,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.800
got a club that presented me to her.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.170
Something that we do before
the students arrive is that we create

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.042
these goodie bags that are given
to the students on their first day.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:54.314
The bag includes some snacks and treats
that the students can enjoy

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:58.451
and an estimated dollar,
which is school currency that you can

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.355
then later buy popcorn
and other treats during special days.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.992
During the month, the bag was created
with the students in mind

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.062
and this logo on the bag was designed

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:12.065
by a grade 12 student named Lucia.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.502
She designed it
with welcome in many different languages

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.272
and is very colorful and bright.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.674
As you can see, as a student
who came to the school

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:25.211
when the welcoming community
was not non-existent,

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.080
it was really hard for me

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.550
because I was alone
and I did not have anybody to guide me.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.587
My first day of school was one
I will never forget

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.023
and for all the wrong reasons.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.492
But with the welcoming community,

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:43.229
I got to help all students
who did not have to experience that.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.968
In my case, I got to have an amazing
friendship with one of the new students.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:54.474
We encourage them to join extracurricular
activities so they feel included.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.478
Like volleyball,
basketball, and auto clubs.
