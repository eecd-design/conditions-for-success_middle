00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.242
Hi. I'm

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.579
Lucy, and I'm a guidance counselor
here at Port Elgin Regional School.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.216
Today, I'm going to talk to you
about restorative circles.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.253
And so what this looks like,
what a restorative circle is to us.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:24.324
At me is, a student can request,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:28.695
a start of school
with another student or teacher.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.832
Some maybe someone that they're having
an issue with, or maybe a group of friends

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.802
would like to request
a restorative circle with

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.506
someone in their class,
or someone else in their friend group.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.009
That's that's bugging them or something's
going on.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.012
Maybe something happened at recess
and they need to figure it out.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.449
They can request a restorative circle.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.454
How it's requested is
students can request it themselves.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.656
A teacher could request like, oh, maybe.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.892
Can you do a restorative circle
with these students?

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.827
I think it would be kind of useful.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.264
That's how restorative
circles are requested.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.034
What they look like is I generally

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:11.037
it changes a little bit depending on

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:15.642
why they want a restorative cycle, but
I try and lay it out similar every time.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.912
So I will start,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.948
like in a circle
and reviewing kind of expectations.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.851
So, only one student talking at a time.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.486
And that's the student
with the talking piece.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.121
They'll all get a chance to share.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.157
So they just have to make sure
that they're listening with the heart

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:35.762
to the other students,
as well as getting to share themselves,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.764
and that it's a safe space.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.000
So whatever's said in the circle
that we have today

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.969
is kind of stays in the circle.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.538
Don't talk about it on the playground.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.307
After,

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:51.778
and the way that I lay it out
is I usually start by getting students

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.648
to take it in turns to share
what happened, because I don't always know

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.816
exactly what happened.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:59.352
If especially it was a playground
incident, like,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.288
okay, just tell me what
happened. Like, I don't know.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.258
So how

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.595
what, what happened or what's going on,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.998
how you're feeling about it.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.868
And that can go two ways,
like how you felt about it at the time,

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.871
how you feel about it now

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:21.941
and then, things that, like,
where can we go from here?

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.979
So students, I get students
to individually think about what they can

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.783
do personally to help this situation
and what they need from other students.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.887
So maybe,

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.188
maybe a student might share.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:40.059
What I can do in this situation
is I can personally walk off if you're,

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.896
if you're annoying me or whatever.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:47.934
Or, and what I need from you is to,

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.304
if I say no, to stop to
to listen to my no.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.973
And that would be an example of that.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:55.542
Yeah.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.545
That's how it's that's how it's laid out.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.713
It can happen like, anywhere.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:04.350
Like in the guidance office,
in the principal's office.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.120
In the classroom, if there's.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.789
I don't tend to do it if there's, like,
other students in the class.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.292
But if it's an empty classroom.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.694
Yeah,

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.362
So it came about,

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.332
quite organically, actually.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:24.771
Admin is very,
good at restorative practices and

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:29.542
really encourages restorative practices
within the school over punishment.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.146
And it kind of just came about organically
that way.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.382
I remember last year,
there was a group of,

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.086
boys in middle school
that had that requested a circle

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.323
with another student in that class,
but which was kind of cool.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:48.294
And just from there, like either
other students have requested it

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.297
or sometimes I, I'm like, okay,
this would be a good time

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.932
to maybe do a restorative circle.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:55.401
Like,
is that something you're interested in?

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.404
And so it just came about that way.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:58.838
okay.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.907
Some tips and tricks
for restorative circles.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:06.312
So one tip I would say is students
don't have to join it.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.182
Like I never force a student
to join a restorative circle.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.284
I always ask,
maybe I'll say, oh, your friend

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.319
Bill and Barb
have requested a circle with you.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.722
Would you like to join us and

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.423
they can say yes

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.460
or no, although I haven't actually
ever had a student say no.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.429
So that's maybe a good size.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:27.033
So, another tip would be for younger
students,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:31.371
you can, always do a restorative circle,
but a great resource,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:35.308
a fantastic teacher in our school found
was something called a peace path.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.111
So, students, it's laid out on the floor.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.746
It's very similar to Restorative Circle.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.214
Similar questions,

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:44.484
but they just face each other
and they kind of move down the path.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.655
And like answering the questions,
sharing how they feel.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.958
And then when they get to the end of the
path, that's when they, same ideas.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.561
And so they come up with some like things
that they can do to resolve it,

00:04:55.895 --> 00:05:00.366
and maybe they leave the circle
with a high five or a hug

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:05.271
or maybe they just walk away
and, say the differences.
