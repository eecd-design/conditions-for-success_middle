00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.976
My name is Sandra Savard.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:13.346
I'm here from Birchmount School
in Moncton, New Brunswick and Anglophone

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.347
East School District.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.817
I want to talk to you, but our PBIs
initiatives, specifically our morning

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:22.255
announcements every day, in order
to keep our PBIs initiatives current

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:26.226
and fresh in the heads of our teachers
and our staff and our students.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.297
We do a month, a daily
reminder of our bare necessities.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:36.536
Each day we identify maybe an area
that needs a little more attention

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:41.007
or a little more focus, and we make that
reminder on the announcements every day.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.208
For example,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.011
we might see that the students
are getting a little noisy in the hallway.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.880
So today's bare necessities

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.417
about being respectful in the hallways
by keeping our voice levels to a whisper.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:55.155
What's been really fun here at Birch Mount
is that that used to be me every day.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.390
Who did those bare necessities
or the reminders?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.327
I identified the area that needed focus
and I made the announcements.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.862
Now we've transitioned to our middle

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.832
school students who are doing
our daily announcements every day,

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.802
and those students have identified
the bare necessities

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.236
that need reminders, though.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.172
So they'll say things to be like,
hey, Miss Virg,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.140
we're noticing
there's a lot of trash on the playground.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.809
We think our Bare Necessities reminder
today

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.511
should be about being respectful,
responsible on the playground

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.246
and they own that and do that every day.
