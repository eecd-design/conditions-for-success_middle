00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.943
My name is Shauna Anderson.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.145
I teach at George Street Middle School.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.148
Grade
seven language arts and social studies.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:21.921
I'm working on, a multi memoir
multi genre member project.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:25.759
And it's basically a way to give students
some choice

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.163
instead of the traditional
just pen and paper writing a narrative.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.001
So the memoir, it's about themselves
and their life experiences,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.805
and it fits in well to our overall theme
this year of identity.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.673
We have,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.843
students from various different
backgrounds and cultures here,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.248
which works and well,
and they do so many different talents.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.649
Kinesthetic.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.452
We have a lot of kids that love writing,

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.654
a lot of kids
that are really into technology.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:58.992
So it just, takes all of their lives
and what they really enjoy

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.995
doing, and it's worked out extremely well.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.965
They do still have the choice
of a personal narrative, but also they can

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:11.805
do a top ten list based on their top ten,
things lessons they've learned in life.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.808
They can do a comic strip of a memory.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.310
They can do a PowerPoint.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.045
We use technology as well.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:22.916
They can write a song or a poem, a script

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:24.484
just.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.687
And I
believe there's 4 or 5 other options.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:31.091
And as I said,
instead of just the traditional narrative,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:37.163
I've seen just a huge increase
in engagement and participation

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.033
and just the quality of the work
is increased.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.104
Doing these kind of choice
projects and again, kind of backing away

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:49.275
from the traditional just one option, it's
all I started out small,

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.913
first, 1 or 2 different options
and then I built upon those.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:57.817
And the more, I started doing it,
the more ideas I came up with

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.486
and the easier it was.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:04.691
At first it is more work because you're
creating rubrics for each of these things.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.593
But, in the end, it is.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.029
It's so much it's worth everything

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.901
to see the kids engagement
and participating and just seeing,

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.538
overall better quality work.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.242
Yeah, I think we a lot of us, when there's

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:26.412
a new initiative or things we, we kind of,
think,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:32.152
oh, this is just something new,
but this just honestly makes make sense.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.822
And it's definitely in everyone's
best interest.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.859
I think in the end, to kind of incorporate
this and make this part of

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.294
their practice.
