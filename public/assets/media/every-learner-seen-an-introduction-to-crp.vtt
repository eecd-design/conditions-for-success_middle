00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.011
Hello middle school educators!

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.781
This short video provides a brief
introduction to culturally responsive

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.249
pedagogy.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.819
I want to start by acknowledging something
that's probably on your mind

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.089
your plates, our full lesson planning,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.192
marketing meetings,
parent emails, assessments.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:30.463
It can be overwhelming if culturally
responsive pedagogy is new to you.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:34.000
You may be thinking, is this really one
more thing I have to do?

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.169
But here's the truth.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:39.172
Culturally responsive teaching
isn't another thing on your plate.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.041
It is the plate.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.209
It's the foundation
that makes everything else more

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.913
meaningful, more effective,
and ultimately more rewarding.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.116
Before we go
any further, let's define what we mean

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.119
by culture
and culturally responsive pedagogy.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.056
Culture is more than ethnicity
or language.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.259
It's the values, traditions,
communication styles,

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:03.129
and lived experiences that shape
how each student sees the world.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.433
It's what we do and why we do it.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.368
Our ways of knowing and being influenced.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.503
How we interpret everything.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.939
Culturally responsive
pedagogy is not a strategy

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.475
or a set of strategies
to add to your practice.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.746
It is a way of teaching a mindset
that underpins everything you do.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.583
One of the preeminent scholars
in this area, Gloria Latson

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:27.887
Billings, defines culturally responsive
teaching as a pedagogical approach

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:32.525
that centers students cultural backgrounds
and experiences to promote

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.663
academic success, cultural competence,
and critical consciousness.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.500
This applies to every student
and teacher in the room.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.837
Teachers
working to become culturally responsive

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.739
recognize
their own cultural ways of being, as well

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.410
as their own biases, so that they can plan
for inclusive practices

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.879
that work for who is in the room.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.746
At its heart,

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:57.350
culturally responsive teaching
is focused on instructional practices

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.621
that create environments where students
feel seen, heard, and valued

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.258
in a way that enhances their engagement
and success.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.961
You may wonder, do I need this?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.264
My classroom isn't diverse,
but culturally responsive

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.267
teaching is an approach
to teaching that benefits everyone.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.603
It's not just about race or ethnicity.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:20.206
Every student has a culture, a way
of seeing and experiencing the world.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:21.741
And when we take time

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.612
to understand their perspectives,
we make learning relevant for all of them.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.582
Culturally responsive teaching
isn't changing what you teach.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.187
It's changing how you connect it to the
lives and experiences of your students.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.725
Now, we know that here in New Brunswick
we have diverse classrooms,

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.695
sometimes with upwards of 10
or 15 home cultures connected.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.799
You might wonder how you can learn about
and connect with all of the cultures

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.034
in your class.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:48.801
And you're right.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.906
You can't be an expert on
every background, but that's not the goal.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.909
The goal is to be curious,
to create a space

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.912
where students feel safe
sharing their perspectives.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.047
You don't have to have all the answers.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.350
You just have to be open
to learning alongside your students.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.955
Incorporate books, videos, and guest
speakers that reflect different cultures.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:13.593
In math, you might explore number systems
from different parts of the world. In

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:17.430
science, you might start by highlighting
contributions from diverse scientists.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.935
And finally, some of you may be thinking,
I've had no training.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:26.339
I don't even know where to start, and
that is a fair and very relevant concern.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.509
I would offer you this. Start small.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.912
Build on what you might already be doing,
like greeting your students by name.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.949
Learning
how to pronounce those names correctly.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.952
Bringing in different voices
and perspectives in your examples.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.620
Asking questions.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.590
Listening using a variety of activities.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.626
Opening up some new ways
to connect with families

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.629
and showing your students
that their stories matter.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.365
Why is this so important?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.735
Culturally and linguistically diverse
students have trouble remembering

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.471
and learning in classrooms
where they are minoritized

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.441
and not valued
for their unique experiences.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:06.145
Feeling unsafe, unseen, or misunderstood
leads to amygdala hijacks,

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.549
wherein the brain produces cortisol
and is unable to learn.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.518
Stereotype threat is another concern.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:16.322
This is the experience of anxiety
or stress that an individual feels

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:19.892
when they feel they are at risk of
confirming a stereotype about their group.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.528
This can lead to impaired performance

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.531
even if the individual knows
the stereotype is not true.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:29.269
For example, a female student
might perform worse on a math test

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:33.006
if she is reminded of the stereotype
that women are not as good at math.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.843
On the other hand,
when students feel affirmed, trusted,

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.778
and validated as who they are,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.948
the teacher can become the warm demander
that students need.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:47.186
And so then they can achieve more
in culturally inclusive environments.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.456
Learners know that they can feel proud
of who they are, as they know

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.459
that their unique identity is respected
and honored.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.629
I know that this is what we want
for all of our students,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.799
but it takes intention to make it happen.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.970
Culturally responsive teaching isn't about
adding another task to your to do list.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.740
It's about transforming
the way you connect with your students.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.044
Thank you for the work you do. It matters.
