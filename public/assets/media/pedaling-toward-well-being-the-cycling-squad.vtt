WEBVTT

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.476
My name is Andrew Titus.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.510
I teach grade seven

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.513
language arts and social studies
at George Street Middle school.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.584
Today I want to talk about
the George Street Cycling Squad.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.087
And how it contributes
to wellbeing at our school.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:27.227
So the cycling club is a group
that I put together a number of years ago,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:32.932
which combines getting kids
outside to ride around on the trails,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.069
to learn basic trail etiquette,

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.974
to learn about the trail network itself
so that they know where they're going

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.744
and they don't get lost,
to learn basic maintenance as well.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.014
And then for some of the kids
who really get into it, we talk about,

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.252
we talk about skills and techniques,
surrounding cycling.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.954
So sometimes for the kids that I have,
that's

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:58.892
about riding fast on the trails
or getting or getting good at it.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.161
This year
I have a bunch of mountain bikers.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.997
So we have been developing
our skills of mountain biking like

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:07.333
climbing and descending,
creating pace lines

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.970
to go fast, learning about gearing and,
and that kind of thing.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.874
So I sort of make it I model it around
the people who are involved

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.910
in the things that they're interested in.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.847
We also have larger organizations
that are become part of this as well.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:25.385
So we have a we have, we have an
initiative at school called spark.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:29.155
And what that is, is three times a year
for four Fridays in a row.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.160
The kids get to choose between a whole
gamut of, activities that we have

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.494
for them.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:39.032
This ranges from archery
to chess to robotics to biking.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.236
And so through the initiative
that I've been able to put in place over

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.874
the last few years, we've
raised a lot of money, and the community

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:51.277
has supported us, and we have created
a fleet of bikes that we have.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.714
So what this does is through spark,
what we're able to do as well is

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:59.185
we can take kids of various levels
of ability and get them out as well.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.855
So we have sort of a beginner's level.
We have an intermediate,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.858
we have an advanced
sort of adventure group that we have.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.428
And so what it does
is it breaks down barriers to kids

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:12.565
who may want to go out and do that,
but for for who whatever reason,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.669
they can't afford or
can't they don't have access to bicycles.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.606
Maybe they
maybe they don't even know how to ride.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.742
I've taught kids actually, like,
starting from scratch how to ride bikes.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.179
But it makes it
so that there is a social component.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.982
They get to meet people
that maybe they wouldn't meet otherwise.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:33.186
They get to get out and get around a city
that maybe they don't have access to,

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:38.258
and they get to ride bikes where they may
or may not have a bicycle themselves.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:44.063
So it I feel as though the George Street
Cycling Squad and in connection

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.867
to spark contributes to wellbeing
in school in a number of different ways.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.102
There's a social way,

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.838
there's an emotional way,
and there's a physical way,

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:55.508
which also extends even into learning
new skills and techniques

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.776
of maintenance and repair.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.713
Any school would need to acknowledge,
first of all, that

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.250
if they want to start a cycling group,
which I strongly recommend,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.154
that they need to accept, first of all,
that not every kid is going to have a bike

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:12.158
and that even if they do have a bike,
it might not be a great bike.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.694
So that might mean that
it doesn't sit well.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.429
In which case
they're not going to enjoy it

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.233
or it mechanically has difficulties,
in which case

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.335
that is potentially even dangerous.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:26.472
So what that means is that means that,
like certain kinds of contact

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:30.143
with the community needs to be made,
not necessarily first,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:34.013
but very, very early on in the development
of your own cycling club.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.483
So what you need to do is
you need to the way that I did it,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.520
which I found to be very effective,
was reach out to the community,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.090
the reach out to the community and say,
does anybody have any bikes kicking around

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.393
that are in their garage,
that are in the basement, that are in

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.363
good working order
that you can deliver to me?

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.399
So that I can
so that I can help other kids?

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.767
That's the first one.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:59.038
The next one is to make contact
with local bicycle shops.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.208
So, you know, it might be one shop.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.810
It might be all of them. Right.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.245
But you need to go and talk

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.648
to the owner of the cycling shop, like,
not the person at the front desk.

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:10.316
And you need to tell them who you are.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:14.454
And my experience has been that if you
speak to the owner of a bicycle shop

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:18.324
and you say, I want to put kids on bikes,
they're on board.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.792
They just want to help.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:22.996
They have been so helpful to me
in so many ways.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.566
They might give you deals on fixing bikes.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.735
They might give you deals on equipment
that you need.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:32.005
They might even they might
even donate bikes that they have.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:37.510
They will almost undoubtedly send
their mechanic over to hang out with you

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.648
for a day, to help you fix bikes
and to teach the kids what they're doing.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:43.416
The next one

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:47.186
is to reach out to the community again,
looking for expertise.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.423
Is there anybody in the community,
either in your teaching community

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.960
or in the community at large,
who is who knows something, right?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.628
Who knows how to fix bikes already?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.331
Who is interested
in hanging out with kids?

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.466
And do they want to help you?

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:04.304
In the last stage is to keep
your eyes open for funding opportunities.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.438
One of the big mistakes

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:09.142
that I made right off the bat was
I took in a whole bunch of donated bikes.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.310
I put in a lot of time

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.313
and effort into fixing them,
and then I started giving them away.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.915
Right now, that's the good part.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:18.718
The bad part is that
I had to do it every year,

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.354
because I would give all the bikes away,
and then the next year would come around.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.588
They wouldn't have any.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:26.225
So what you need to do is
you need to build like a fleet of bikes

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.961
and then sort of
have some that are on rotation.

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.964
And the way to do that
is to look for funding opportunities.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:36.069
Now that could be inside the school system
as a whole, or it might be outside.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:41.140
I was very, very fortunate in the fact
that because I'm a cyclist myself

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.511
and I'm connected to my own
cycling community, that word came my way,

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:50.416
that there was an organization called
the Sotherton Medical Staff Association

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:54.354
who were looking to fund a wellness
initiative

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.790
inside the community
somewhere that had to do with kids.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.126
And it was a perfect fit for me.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:03.296
So I wrote up a long description
about what we do and why it's important,

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.532
which is exactly the same
kind of information I'm giving you.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.935
I submitted my application
and forgot about it.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:12.372
About six months later,
I received word from them

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.742
that I had been granted
a fairly substantial amount of money.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:19.979
And with that, I was able to buy bikes.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:25.852
I was able to buy used bikes, new bikes,
equipment, tools, all that kind of stuff,

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:29.155
which now I have as the core of my

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.325
of my, of my collection of bikes.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.594
Then when people donate them,
I can fix them up or whatever.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.429
And those are the bikes that I give away.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:42.268
So I always have some, and so looking for
funding opportunities is crucial.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.404
So I would say reach out
to your community,

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.407
connect with your bike shop,
look for funding opportunities.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:51.177
And if you can secure all of those, like,
I think that you can have a very

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.079
healthy, long term,

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.749
life to your to your to your biking clubs.
