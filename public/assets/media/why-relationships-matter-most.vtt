Hi. My name is Michelle Mccaughan-Wilcox,

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.447
and I'm the secretary at River Valley
Middle School.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.817
And I've been working for the district
for 33 years.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:23.289
I am talking about student relationships
and how important it is to them and me.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.093
I talk to them like they're my own kids.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.797
I listen and offer opinions.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.600
I share my own experiences

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.603
and stories, whether they're good or bad.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.039
I have kids that visit me every day

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.742
a couple times a day,
and they all tell me they love me.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.612
And my reply to them is, I love you more.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.615
So yeah, I think it's important.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.886
I'm a safe place
and I stoop to their level and I'm just.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.288
I'm just me. The secret is on me.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:58.091
And you know,
I dish it right back to them.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.626
Someone asks, how many kids do you have?

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.028
I say 304.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.263
Even in front of the parents.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.800
I'll look at the parents
and I'll say, I talk to them like my kids.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.867
And they said, that's awesome.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.236
I'm like, I'm not a secretary to them.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.038
I find kids in middle school, they

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.374
they get to know

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.644
we're normal too,
or they're just as normal as us.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.779
And we have crap too.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.215
And I think it's important that they hear
that, that, you know,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.650
we don't live here at the school.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.653
When we do go home and, you know,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.422
what happens behind closed doors

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.425
is everybody's life, not just theirs.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.528
So I think that helps them to that

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.231
crappy things and happy things happen.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.999
It goes both ways.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.201
So just be yourself.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.402
Be honest.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.071
Dish it
whether they want to hear it or not.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.574
Sometimes they need to hear it,
and maybe they're not hearing

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.575
it where they should be.
