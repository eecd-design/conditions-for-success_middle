WEBVTT

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:08.708
All right.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:09.542
So my name is Sadie

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.413
Chantler I'm the 6 to 8 later margin
teacher at Port Elgin Regional School

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.618
I'm Stefan Martin I'm the 6 7
8 math teacher on the English side.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.955
And up until halfway through this year
is also acting vice principal.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.725
We'll be talking to you today
about the project

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.461
based learning program at our school.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:28.728
Yeah.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.832
So if you come and visit us and check out
our PBL blog, what you might see is that,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:37.470
you'll see a mixture of 5 to 8 students,
in every class.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.806
So it's truly,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.943
a multi age setting where we combine
our students from grades 5 to 8

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.479
and we augment the curriculum with topics
that,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.282
we find very engaging
and our students find very engaging.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:53.853
So they'll go for eight weeks,
with a given topic that they've selected.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.624
So we will present to them
the eight topics or seven topics

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:01.127
depending on how many are offered,
at the beginning of the term.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.029
And the students will make

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.066
their selections
based on the descriptions of that topic.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.167
And then for the next eight weeks,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.403
they will be with that teacher,
for one hour every morning.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.207
And it was really designed,
five years ago when we started this

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.410
as a way of getting kids to the school
and getting kids engaged.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.815
So we start our morning off
with this, this choice activity.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.284
Yeah.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:27.921
So in terms of assessment,
it will look different in each PBL block

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.122
depending on what the teacher's comfort

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.158
level and skill set is,
but something that's common between

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.161
all of the PBL blocks is the reflections
that kids are doing.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.798
Whether that be daily or weekly,
based on what they learned, how

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:42.235
they feel about it, what things went well,
what things need to improve, and,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.673
the goals that they, are looking
to achieve throughout their PBL block.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.210
Another thing that's also common
to all of the PBL blocks

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.513
and is probably the biggest part
of our assessment, is our,

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.549
showcase that the students
do at the end of each block.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.921
So they create a five minute presentation
to talk about what they learned

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.493
over the course of eight weeks,
as well as the answer to the big question.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.764
And that big question is the driving
force behind each PBL block,

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.101
the big theme, the the big idea,
whatever you want to call it.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:19.005
But they're answering that question
in that showcase, and that showcase,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.774
they're doing that presentation.
They're doing it to the community.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:26.346
So parents, other community members,
people, business

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.349
owners in the community as well as people
from district are invited in

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.717
to come and watch these presentations.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.786
And let's talk about that showcase
for a second.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.824
Two, because I don't know about you, but
I really like the way it's it's come on.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.791
Absolutely. Yeah.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.960
Because we we would
we didn't always do it like that.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.931
Originally our showcase five years ago
was just the students would be presenting

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.735
to each other and segment them
into like a third or a half of the kids,

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.871
and they would present
to the other students in small groups.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.774
And what we found is
it was a lot of traffic.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.677
It was a lot of behavior management.
It was a lot of management on our part.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.447
And it was a less of getting to enjoy
what the kids have learned

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.717
and getting to see the fruits
of what they've done.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.688
And when you're looking at engagement,
that's what we want to see

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.957
is the engagement rather than, you know,
the management piece.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.126
So we moved to this
like community based one.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.895
And, I find has gone
the we've only tried twice,

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.831
but I find it's gone a lot smoother, a lot
smoother. Yeah, yeah.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.600
And the community members seem
they like it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.670
The, the, the parents come in
and they get to see what the kids

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.737
have been doing for eight weeks.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.873
So it's been a
nice little outreach piece.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.275
And on our end, I think it helps us
with the assessment piece.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.710
So instead of trying to run around

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.713
and see all of the individual
presentations that are happening,

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.683
we're able to take our time
and and take a look at them.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:40.653
But also give them the feedback
during the preparation

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.356
part of the president of the showcase
presentation.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.457
So yeah, yeah.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.359
And from an administration lens as well.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.094
And I know our administrators
really like this

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.297
piece is that it really holds
us accountable to In the Block

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:54.334
as educators to make sure
that our assessment is is top notch.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:54.601
Throughout.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.604
We've got the formative assessment,
throughout the PBL.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.739
We've got the summative at the end
and in the showcase.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.842
But in order to do a good showcase,
they have to prepare the showcase.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.544
They have to practice the showcase.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:07.780
So it really it really keeps us
accountable for that planning piece.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.681
And it helps us to create

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.485
better blocks, which I found even though
I've I've run archery for five years,

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.923
I've now developed a much better block
now than I did five years ago.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.592
So that's a huge piece to absolutely.
