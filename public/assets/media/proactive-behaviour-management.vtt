00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.909
Hi, I am Matt Ripley.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.479
I am the vice principal here
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.482
And I'm going to talk a little bit
about students reporting on behavior.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.951
Which can be a tricky topic
in middle school.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.988
You know, we know that students,
as they progress, it becomes,

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:26.393
harder and harder to tell teachers,
what what's happening?

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:26.626
You know,

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:29.629
students want to become more independent
and they want to solve problems on their

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.263
on their own.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.700
And also, the role of peers becomes
more important as they progress through.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.868
So it kind of gets tricky.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.638
They don't want to be seen as,
as a rat or a tattletale or somebody who's

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:41.408
who, who's telling,
because that can kind of escalate

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.643
a problem
rather than fix it in their eyes.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:48.214
So to do that, you know, we really do
work on building relationships early.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.484
We want to make sure that the kids
feel safe to come to us.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.052
Right.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.488
And sometimes that means
having an explicit conversation with them.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.390
Hey, I know that was hard, you know,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.360
and I'm not sure
how you want me to help you,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.029
because I don't want to make the problem
worse. What would you like me to do?

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.498
How would you like me
to support you in this problem?

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.400
Would you like me
to talk to the other student?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.069
Do you just want me to listen?

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.371
And that really gives them
some guidance, right?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.642
If they don't want to be seen
as somebody who's telling or or tattling,

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.810
then we can kind of support them

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.613
through that, and we can show discretion,
but we can still deal with the problem,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.247
you know?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.118
And sometimes if a problem needs
to be dealt with, we absolutely will.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.954
Right.
And we'll do that as, as, as best we can.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.991
But to make sure that we do have a safe
space for students to report, that's

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.293
that's really important here.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.965
In middle school, we always want to foster
a growth mindset.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.601
All students are going to make mistakes.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.206
We have brains that are under development
and sometimes we react out of emotions.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:52.178
And if students can understand that, hey,
sometimes I react out of anger

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.280
or fear or sadness

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.784
and I say something or do something that
might be a little bit out of character.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.820
If students can see that in themselves,
then they can start

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.823
to see that
maybe other people do that too, right?

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.559
And if you see that, hey, you know,
even though this is my friend

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.862
and we had this problem,
maybe these people,

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.830
maybe they weren't
acting out of their best selves.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.732
Maybe they
they they really did make a mistake.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:16.669
And then we can start to kind of see through that and then start to grow and heal.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.105
Something else we do

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.675
here is, alternative alternatives
to suspension.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:27.814
You know, we want to avoid sending kids
home as a disciplinary measurement.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.550
Sometimes it takes a day to reset.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.921
But it's really important
for us to get them back in here.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.857
And sometimes that means they're not
with the classroom for a little while.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:42.462
They might be in, in school intervention,
where they're working on

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:46.866
skill building, whatever skill is lagging,
whatever skill that they could use

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.635
to support them
with whatever the problem is,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.237
that's what we'll focus
and that's what we'll target on.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.272
And we can do that here.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.974
So we're we are learning
from our mistakes.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:58.511
Any mistake that students make here
is an opportunity to grow.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.580
And sometimes that mistake is behavior.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.449
Sometimes it's
it's about emotional regulation.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.853
Sometimes it's about,
you know, not recognizing,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.923
something important in a friendship
and taking that for granted.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.392
But any one of these mistakes
we can learn from,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.395
and we want to give kids an opportunity
to do that and to grow,

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.631
honestly, it's a better conversation
with parents, too.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.801
You know, if I call a family and say, hey,
I have to send your kid home for three

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.204
days, they're suspended.
That's not going to go well.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.705
But if we say, hey,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.708
your child showed these behaviors
and we'd love to work with them on that.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.711
So, we're going to take some time
and we're going to build those skills

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.045
with them.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.081
And at the same time, we'll be able
to keep them up to date on the work

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.783
so they won't miss anything. Right?

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.952
That's always a much better conversation.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.520
And I think the kids see that too.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.423
They want a chance to fix things.
They want a chance to grow.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.557
They don't want to be sent away.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.227
They want to feel that even
if they make a mistake, they still belong.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:47.961
And they still matter.
