00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.766
And today was going to

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.766
be a busy day,
but thankfully I did some prep at home.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.233
I packed my gym clothes last night,
helped to make my lunch this morning,

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:15.333
and double checked if I had my materials
for my drama presentation this afternoon.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
My bags felt like
my back was going to break.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.700
Once I get to my locker.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
I catch up with my friends.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.166
I know I have 25 minutes to get ready.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.600
I start by checking my locker

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
checklist that I created
at the beginning of the year.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.766
I have my pencil case, binder,
and water bottle.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.900
I have the option of leaving my phone in
my locker or in a container in my class.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.166
I personally like to leave mine
in my locker, but you can do what works

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.100
for you.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.633
Next, I change my shoes to grab a snack
and go to my water.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.266
After locking the lock.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
I usually get to homeroom around 810.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
I eat my snack while double
checking my binder for any work

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
that might need that day.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.633
I try to use the washroom at this time

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.966
because if I don't, I'll have to wait
two hours until break.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.566
When I went to the washroom,
I realized I forgot my charger,

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:30.300
so I quickly grabbed it from my locker
and thankfully I remembered

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.400
because my laptop was almost dead.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
I'll try to remember
to charge it at night.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.433
At 1030 I get a 15 minute break.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.900
I spend this time
refilling my water bottle,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.200
using the washroom and getting snack
before I go hang out with my friends.

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.333
At our two minute warning bell.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.133
My friends and I get our materials
from our lockers before heading to class.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.700
At lunch
time, I enjoy eating with my friends.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.666
If I don't have any club meetings, I
go outside, but I use the washroom before.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.733
Some of my friends prefer going to
the washroom before a period for snacks.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.133
That makes me feel too rushed.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.133
Lunch can be really busy sometimes,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.566
but I can always get one of my super
organized friends to help me.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.666
Like filling up my water bottle.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
After school
can be a bit of a rush to catch the bus,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.066
so I quickly go to my locker,

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:36.966
make sure I bring everything home
that I brought that day.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:40.866
I don't think my mom wants to buy me a
water bottle, so I'm trying to get better.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.933
I bring it home if I can.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.933
I tidy my locker
so I'm better prepared tomorrow morning.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
And that's a day in
the life as compared student

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.533
and. Little guys.
