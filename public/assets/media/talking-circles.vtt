00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.843
Hi. I am Matt Ripley.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.379
I am the vice principal
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.747
And today I'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.083
about how we use circles
with our students.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.820
So I guess a couple of different ways
we can use circles.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.123
One of them would be a restorative circle.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.426
So our restorative circle
would be in response

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.263
to a conflict between two students
or a group of students.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.500
Basically, when feelings have been hurt
or emotions are running

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.669
high and we want to heal
and we want to rebuild a relationship.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.939
So those types of circles
are usually a lot smaller.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.110
They'll be with the students involved
and perhaps a few adults.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.478
Maybe the guidance counselor,

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.248
but they stay pretty small
and they stay quite focused.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:52.919
And the purpose of that is to heal or,
you know, give students a chance

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:56.122
to express their point of view
and their side of things

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.259
so that we can rebuild the relationship
and move on.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.795
Before we do that, there's some groundwork
that needs to happen.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.363
First, we want to make sure
that we've interviewed

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.534
both students or all students involved,
and we've gotten their side of the story.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.270
And to make sure that they're in a space
where they're ready to do this.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.205
One thing we don't

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.208
want to do is for students to apologize.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:18.178
So to do this, you know,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.014
if if an apology comes,
it should be authentic.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:26.419
And this type of format allows students
to really express their point of view.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.055
Why they're hurt,
why they're feeling that way,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.292
or to defend their actions so
they can explain why they did something.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.929
And usually with that,
the apology comes authentically

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.932
and organically,
and it means so much more of that way.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.602
Another way we use
circles are a whole class,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.872
so we'll sit with either a whole class
or we'll do half of the class

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.307
at the time while the other class

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:50.276
is working on another social
emotional piece of learning.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:55.548
But in those circles will specifically
teach skills, such as conflict

00:01:55.548 --> 00:02:01.488
resolution, emotional recognition,
emotional regulation, or building empathy.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.724
So with those,
there's always an attack in intent.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.727
So we'll start by, you know,
doing a little bit of mindfulness

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.930
breath work, and then we'll share
the intent of the circle that day.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.000
Sometimes I'll come with an intent
or sometimes

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.269
I'll talk to the teacher beforehand
and we'll see.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.537
Is there anything that's happening

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.772
in your classroom
that we really should touch upon?

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.841
So you have to be flexible sometimes.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.245
The intent of the circle can change
depending on on

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.248
what's happening in the school that week
or that day.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.717
With that, students can always pass,

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.953
and we don't force them to participate,
but we really do encourage them.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.524
So the way we do
that is basically at the first question,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:41.261
the first time around the circle,
we start with something easy to, to,

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:41.895
to get by.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.796
And maybe it's something as simple as
tell me

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.265
your name and your favorite animal.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.736
And then it gets a little bit more tricky
or a little bit deeper or more emotional

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.436
as we go in.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.539
And if students are kind
of following the process,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.108
they'll start to see that
this is a safe place to share.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.877
I can talk about how I feel here,
and people aren't going to laugh at me,

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:01.347
or they're not going to turn around
and and tease me after this is over.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.918
So once they get that by
and you really do see students, you know,

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.821
after a week or two, you know, they
they buy into the process and they become

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.824
a lot more comfortable with opening up
and telling us how they feel.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.228
I think, well, starting with easy

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.565
questions is a really important one
to get that by.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.701
And some students aren't comfortable with
the process right away, so they need it.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.004
They need that time to to understand
that it is a safe space.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.239
And you have to build that.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.075
You have to, you know, explicitly
say this is a safe space.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.611
And what we talk about here
is really important.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:35.615
So that that's why
we do a little bit of mindful meditation

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.117
before it really kind of resets
the nervous system.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.253
And then we can set the tone
that this is a place where

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.822
we're going to speak from our heart,
and we're going to listen from our heart,

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:47.360
and we're going to understand
that everybody comes

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.531
with their own unique perspective,
and we can learn from everybody here.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:52.999
And when you set that tone,

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.735
the students will fall in line
and they'll really believe that.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.671
And and once once they do, it's amazing
what they share.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:02.842
You know, I'm always impressed with
with how they demonstrate their learning

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.812
and and how they grow emotionally.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:10.984
I guess another thing would be to make
sure you're being flexible and responsive.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:14.020
You know, we always set our intention
at the beginning of the circle,

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.923
but it may go in a different direction.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.893
Some students may share
things that may be off topic,

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.497
but you have to realize right away,
maybe what they're sharing

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:28.201
is so important that we may have to adjust
what we're talking about, right?

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.204
So even if you have an intent,
make sure you're being responsive

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.906
to the students in the conversations
that are happening in front of you.
