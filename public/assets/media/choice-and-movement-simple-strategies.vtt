00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:08.742
My name

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.911
is Kelly Loukes, I am a research teacher
at George Street Middle School.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.015
My name is Courtney
Grandy and I am a resource teacher

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.082
at George Street Middle School.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.619
So warm up would be when you come in
and enter the math classroom.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.755
It's just the way that you start
your class every day.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.492
So students kind of expect
or know what to expect when they walk in.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.226
They look at the board,

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.628
they see their warmup question,
and they get started on it.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.897
So it might not just be
the one question on the board.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:34.734
You see lots of different questions
or different types of things to be doing.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.572
So there's as much choice as possible
included in the warm questions day.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.442
And in those warm months.
It's really great to offer students.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.780
And so that's all students have something
that they are able to achieve

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.183
as a beginning warm up activity
to get to class started.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:55.321
So there may be an element of writing
and for drawing or,

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:59.059
brainstorming with a friend,

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.062
list, making a list

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.799
that they can choose from,
that all segments and content.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.703
I would say it's also important
to have different types of questions

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.706
as part of the warm up,
even though you're providing choice.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.876
So an example could be up
for simple math questions

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.413
that maybe two of them are a little more
challenging than the others.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.884
And then also providing a challenge
or a bonus question on top of those so

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.954
students feel like they are accomplishing
something a little extra,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.324
and they usually are able to attempt
no matter what level they are at.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.327
That's so students
do why they think about the concept

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.964
that you're going to introduce
in a creative way, or it provides

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.201
a review of a concept
that has already been taught

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.472
to to go into the
class and the concept slowly.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.341
And like,

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.145
or you said, where you'd have students
working at different levels

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.148
and who are able to show what they know

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.284
best in a different variety of ways,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.722
if you ask them choice and how they,
present that warm up to you.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:06.526
So it could be a writing prompt,
but instead of writing, perhaps they could

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:10.196
use to draw their answer,
I would in my classroom, I would have

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.698
a seating chart.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.934
Everyone would know the seating started,
but once it came to work time,

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.035
there were multiple

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.672
flexible spots that they could move to
to work with a partner or different group.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.375
Different things that they could work on.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:26.012
Would be
there would be lots of choices available.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.514
It was a practice activity.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:31.351
They might choose between moving around
to see different tasks,

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.255
or they may choose to do it color
by number, sort of activity at their seat,

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.359
or they may choose to do a partner
practice activity instead.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.995
There was always multiple choices
available.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.265
Even if it's a even
if everyone was doing a task

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.801
card activity, you could even still have
different task cards at each station.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.569
So they were choosing

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.272
from different levels of questions
to be working on,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.440
and they could make that choice,
question to question.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.412
It could be a type of activity where it's
the same answer of a different question.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.549
So there might be different levels
of the questions that they're working

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.552
on, different, different questions

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.555
from page to page,
but they all have the answer.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.525
So it wouldn't matter who partnered up
or what level they choose to work on.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.128
They are seniors,
so they could still work together.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:18.364
And as far as flexible seating,
those being a resource teacher

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.332
and being

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:23.169
in and out of different classrooms
throughout the day, I feel teachers here

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.873
do offer a variety of flexible
seating arrangements.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.242
So there and within each classroom,

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.712
there's usually a corner
where students can choose to work or read

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.416
or do whatever task is
asked of them by themselves.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:40.119
There's also desk space
so that they could work with a partner

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:45.024
or a small group, and then the teacher
usually has an area where she

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.994
or they can call upon individual students

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.030
to come and work with them as well.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.267
A lot of teachers will even set up,

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:58.338
little areas outside of their classroom
that can be closely monitored.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:01.374
But still offer another avenue of,

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:05.311
space
for students to work on whatever tasks.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.014
I would say

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.184
it seems like a bigger thing than it is.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.887
When you think about UDL as a big picture,
it feels like this

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:18.291
really huge thing to implement
and this really big, scary change to me.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.128
But it's actually quite simple
to implement small parts of UDL.

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:25.431
So going back to the warm up,
that's a simple way of here's

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.934
some different choices
for you to start your day off.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:32.272
Most math teachers would have practice
time in their day already,

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:36.442
so it's just providing an extra
couple choices available to students.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.944
So it's not starting from scratch.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.447
It's just kind of tweaking
what you're already doing

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.550
and already planning
to have those extra choices available.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.154
And I would say the other part,
especially with the flexible

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.457
seating and areas around
the, is to get to know your students.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:55.995
They
if you ask them or quiz them somehow,

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:59.032
they probably can tell you
they prefer school, or

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.402
they prefer to work alone
or with a partner.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.271
And you can easily plan for that
with a quick

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.274
seating plan before the activity begins.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:13.680
So another great strategy, is students
providing some movement,

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:16.949
being in and out of classrooms
as a resource teacher,

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.186
I've seen lots of teachers
who planned a specific movement

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:23.823
break within their classroom,
and the students love it.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.660
So whether it be a quick doing that,
they all stand up and play.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.063
Sometimes
it's a minute to run an activity.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:35.335
Sometimes it's a challenge where
they're asked to try something like that,

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.970
and it just allows them.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.342
And the excitement and the team building
and townhouses is amazing.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.445
Other activities I've seen for movement

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:49.282
is, having cards posted around the room.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.518
Could just be a simple
yes no, I'm not sure.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:56.689
On each wall and the students
are given a question about the content

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:01.794
they're learning or something fun,
and they have to move to that answer.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.597
Around the room that they agree with.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:07.633
And then they have a group of people
who they can discuss

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:11.604
that answer with them and figure out why

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.640
why they chose an answer,
but it allows them to.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.543
My biggest change
that I would see is students

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:21.714
that would specifically be on
an adjusted plan or an accommodated plan,

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:24.951
who used to find school work
very challenging.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:28.955
Having those choices available
really made an impact for those students.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.392
They would see those choices as something

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:36.896
that they were able to accomplish,
and it seemed more achievable to them.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.899
So they felt more confident
leaving the math classroom.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:44.737
And I would say that, biggest change
I've seen for some students

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:49.075
since I was too often
presented with behavioral challenges,

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.912
there was less attention
because they were allowed

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.415
to speak with their friend
that they needed to.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.618
They were allowed to work on their own
if they needed to.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:02.321
So that's behavior challenges for sure.

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:08.561
And then the productivity of the kids to
surprise you with what they will present

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.132
when given the opportunity
to work in the area of the environment

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:18.137
that allows them to be the most creative
and more confident, is showing what it is.
