WEBVTT

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:08.975
So I'll just.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:14.214
I'll just, explain for all of our guests
kind of how best.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.915
Run.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.985
So Melanie is our taskmaster,

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.988
which means she's managing the agenda
in real time.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.693
Kelly is on the shared document
keeping the meeting notes.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.563
Angela, as we break her up, continuously,

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:35.869
then takes any of those that have been,
submit because some are updates

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.005
that don't necessarily
go through s connect for referral.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:43.209
But those that worry in for a referral
or are specific to a student.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.414
Angela is great just to jump on s connect
and add those in.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.284
I generally am the timekeeper
because that's the easiest job

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.853
and the hardest job is
when you have good conversation

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.689
of knowing when to pull the plug,
because we'll never get out of here.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.192
So I don't mind being the bad guy on that.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.529
Whitney keeps our action items,
so it's really easy

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.665
at a big, structured meeting to say,
yeah, I'll do that.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.468
And if we don't write down
who has to do what?

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.305
Because when we leave here at 11, 1130,
it's easy to forget.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.574
I agreed to do ten different things.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.878
So Wendy just basically keeps track of,
the action items

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.413
that each staff member has.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.416
And I'll just remind, everyone

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.220
we need those and, your action
items out after the meeting.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.190
So remember, those are in your emails.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.093
Some you can get to because of the nature
of what they are.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.761
Some just have to get pushed.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.163
Don't ever feel.
You know, I didn't get to that.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.399
I got to check it off
the box and do it, you know,

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.103
do it and
do it well when it's appropriate to do it.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.072
And it's okay just to say, you know,
I didn't get to that this week.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.742
Caitlin takes the notes that Kelly has,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.813
and she edits them down to a staff
friendly version.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:58.852
And then Caitlin sends them out
to all staff after the meeting.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.123
For us, this is,
this is an opportunity there.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.659
And this is a we've said
it was feedback to,

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.662
Angela at the meeting, but

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:13.466
teachers and staff are not accustomed
to going disconnect

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.870
to see everything
that was put in for a meeting.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.473
And we can't release
all the confidential information.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.244
So we do the second version of our notes
as a way, so they can see

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.680
all of the items that were discussed,
all of the updates.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.317
We've always sent them out

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.320
via email
because then it does sit in their inbox

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.424
and it really just erase is the ability
to say, I didn't know that it would be a

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:42.529
that on them to not open the email
and check through what was there.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.364
But everyone is given the opportunity.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.134
And because, emails do get bogged down
even for teachers.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.303
So we do upload them to our site

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.540
and everyone has access to
to take a look at that where they're at.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:57.310
It's every staff members responsibility

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.782
to have anything that's going to be talked
about in our shared agenda by 3 p.m.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:03.616
yesterday.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:07.387
There's always the one off of,
you know, this just came up this morning

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.622
and it should be discussed.
But those are one offs.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.823
Those should be the norms.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:15.094
So, it does try and keep the meeting
running smoothly.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:19.132
The first part of the agenda is sequence
to really to be updates,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:23.136
which means it's either a data update,
or it's a quick hit.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.806
So the agenda items are maybe long,
but they move fast.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:30.076
But anything that's a discussion
related to a student

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:34.447
is related in the student sections,
because we sequence them by grade level.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.684
Students that are on the agenda
are in blue,

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.853
which means we talk about them every week,
even if there's not a referral.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.891
Just even if it's anecdotally, have
we noticed that the baseline is continued,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.228
or is there a spike during the need
to make a decision on that?

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.163
Are they on a short term intervention?

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.833
Do we need to, you know, reevaluate
their data or whatever that looks like?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.237
And then our ones that are not in blue
are essentially new referrals.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.272
They're not talked about every week.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:03.142
There could be an academic referral
or someone who's baseline is escalating

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.980
behavior wise, or someone that,
you know, a parent reached out to.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.850
So, Caitlin and then, you know,
she raised that that is a concern

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.684
that's happening at the school.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.687
So something that's not necessarily
on our agenda for us

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.589
kids in blue,
sometimes there's no discussion.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.758
It's just status quo.
And we'll move along.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.761
And then other times we give
about a five minute window to talk.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.931
That's
where the as the timekeeper kind of rolls

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.167
in for me to say,
you know, we've kind of reached our max.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.637
We're nowhere near, an end of a meeting.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.539
We probably have to have an ad hoc
meeting, related to this.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.376
And then we'll identify a timeline
for some of the staff members.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:40.413
So that's kind of an overview
of our of our process.
