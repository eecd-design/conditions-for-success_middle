00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.709
I'm Matt Ripley.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.079
I am the vice principal here
at Marshview Middle School in Sackville,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.813
New Brunswick.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.450
And the topic I'm going to talk about
today is wellbeing at school.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:22.689
This topic relates to,
our district improvement plan,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.725
which the goal is that every student
will feel safe and cared for,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.461
which also aligns with one of our goals
here at school.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.131
We want everybody to feel safe
and we want to feel it.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.333
We want everybody to feel like
they belong.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.703
So part of that, of course, involves
student relationships with each other.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:40.607
We want to foster a culture where students
feel safe and respected throughout.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.511
But something that we do intentionally
here is one of our school improvement

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.546
goals, is to make sure
that we are connected.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.549
All of our students are connected
with a safe adult here in the building.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.052
And we do that
in a couple of different ways.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.956
One way is that when students
enter in grade five or when a new student

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.858
comes to our school for the first time,

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.861
we'll have an interview,
usually with our guidance counselor, to

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.331
just get to know them a little bit better,
see what their interests are.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.001
See if they have any preferred
names or pronouns.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.570
And then very quickly,
we move to making sure that they have

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.573
a safe adult here at school
with whom they feel connected.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.376
Oftentimes it can be the homeroom teacher,
and usually it is,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.211
especially with our younger kids.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.015
But it doesn't necessarily have to be,
they can feel connected with the guidance

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.785
counselor or the behavior mentor,
or sometimes it's even the custodian who

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.989
they feel a connection with or
or an administrator or a former teacher.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.725
Sometimes it's somebody
they've known in the community,

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.962
but the important thing is that they have
somebody that they feel safe with.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:42.001
We know that throughout middle school,
developmentally, children tend to.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.369
Well, the rolling out of adults

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.207
in their lives tend to diminish slowly
over time in the role of friendships

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.210
and peers becomes more and more important,
which is a good thing.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.780
But as they kind of navigate
the ups and downs in middle

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.582
school,
it's important that there's a safety net.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.951
It's important
that they have somebody to go to.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.986
And when that's not the case, students

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.855
will often try
to solve problems on their own.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:02.822
And sometimes when

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.325
when something comes to the office,
that's usually what it is, is

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.294
the student was trying to fix something,
they were trying to solve a problem,

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.897
and it got bigger than them,
and they didn't know when to seek help.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.934
So if we foster those relationships
and make sure that they do have a safe

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.337
and caring adult in their lives
here in the building,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.907
that maybe they will start to go for help
and then they will feel safe and secure,

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.509
to come and talk to us.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.843
if a student is struggling,

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.980
you know, we'll have a conversation
with staff members who who do they have?

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:30.016
Do they have a safe adult
who has a connection with that kid?

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.019
And if we don't have an answer to that,
then we're going to have to find one.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.088
You know, we'll have to work with that kid
and reach out

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.224
and make sure they do have a connection,
or they do have a safe person to talk to.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.262
Another way we can do
that is through our advisory program.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.898
This year, advisory is with homeroom.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:49.068
It's about 20 minutes throughout the day,
but it really does

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:52.839
give a time
where we can talk about other things.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:56.943
You know, it kind of takes our foot off
the gas in terms of academics and allows

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:00.213
that space to have conversations
about safety and well-being.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.514
Advisory

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.183
gives a chance for students
to talk a little bit

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.186
more openly and freely about
what's really going on in their lives.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.089
And it gives the teachers a chance
to kind of talk to them, you know,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.827
in a real way, rather than about math
or whatever the subject matter is.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:15.795
So for us,

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:19.832
I think if there's one takeaway,
it is to start with building relationships

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.670
and do it early, find those kids
whenever there's a new one.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.371
You know, reach out, connect with them,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.374
you know, have a conversation,
find out what makes them tick.

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.011
Because if you invest in that early on,
then it really does pay dividends

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.014
later on, especially
when things start to get a little bumpy.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.650
So we want to create
those positive experiences early on.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.553
So we have that relationship to draw
on when we need it later on.
