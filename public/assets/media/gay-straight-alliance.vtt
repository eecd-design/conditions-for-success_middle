Hi, my name is Trish

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.412
and I am a contract teacher
at Birchmount School.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.982
I'm here to talk about our GSA,
our gender Sexuality Alliance,

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.552
and how it became part
of our essential school learning.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:25.091
Here at Birchmount, we've had a GSA
for as long as I can remember.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.561
Originally, it kind of was a little more

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:32.332
under the radar,
but one particular teacher took it on.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.635
And over the last few years,
particularly with the political climate,

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:40.106
we've really been pushing to ensure
that it is very overt

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:44.244
that students are very aware
that we recognize the importance

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.948
and that we provide the same equality
for students with gender, sexuality

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.420
concerns We we really make sure
that all students understand

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.758
that they are equal regardless of gender,
sexuality, skin color, religion, culture.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.862
And providing
that GSA group is really important

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.933
for students to have a place to go,
to have confirmation conversations

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.770
with each other and with adults to know,
you know, questions

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.007
they may have or just understanding
their are as accepted.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.278
One of the really big things
that I have found, particularly

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.948
over the last couple of years,
is the importance of having someone

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:25.385
that is a role model to the students
that is running your GSA.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.188
Obviously, it's ideal
if you can have more than one adult within

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:32.125
your building that can be part of it
and be more of that safe person.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.497
But students really can resonate
when there is one person that they know

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:42.669
very overtly, very consistently
is that person they can go to.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.272
So for me personally,
it was really easily easy to do that

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.141
because I wear my rainbows all the time.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.909
I'm very, very huge on equality.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.947
I've been part of LGBTQ
plus for most of my life,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:58.651
so it was a very natural transition
for me to be able to step into that role

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.255
and provide that for students,
because I was already doing that.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:06.392
GSA just makes it a little more formal,
where we have meetings every week and

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:10.697
allow the students to have conversations,
plan events, particularly pride.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:12.065
We usually plan our pride events

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.869
that are coming up,
and there are lots of other things.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.070
So it's very student led.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.706
So they provide the kind of agenda.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.376
I just act as a role to help
keep them on track.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:26.146
So this is what we talked about this week.
What do you want to talk about this.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:30.283
You know, last week,
that kind of idea that sparked my my job,

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:35.188
So the biggest thing that I recommend to
schools is making sure that whoever is

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:40.527
taking on the role of advisor for the GSA
is really, truly passionate about it.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.195
The students can feel that.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:47.233
And it really does help the students
to be able to articulate, to you

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:52.238
and feel safe to express to you concerns,
questions, comments that they might have.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.608
That's the biggest thing
that I can recommend.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:03:00.680
And really having making sure that
everyone knows who that person is within

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.118
the whole school, regardless of age, is
everyone needs to know.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.154
And so that's my biggest recommendation
