00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.943
My name is Dominic Hachey.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.412
I'm the academic support teacher
for literacy here at Dr.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.246
Losier Middle School.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.981
I'm also the literacy speaker.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.051
So part of that role for me means that I'm

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.454
in charge of the data and accountability
for the literacy department here.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.593
So what that looks like
is all of our units that we

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:30.597
we pre and post
test on gets housed on spreadsheets

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.600
throughout, throughout the year.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.636
All of those spreadsheets
are readily available

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:40.173
to all of our teachers on a team's page,
where it's where it's housed.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.744
And basically what that allows us to do
is when we pre

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:48.915
and post test our kids,
we get a picture of where they're at.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.486
So we use red green and yellow
red, meaning they didn't get it,

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.923
green meaning they got it yellow meaning
they're on their way to getting it.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.062
So what that looks like in our PLC
is when we have all of our data,

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.665
I can go to our PLC
as, as our SPR and say,

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.002
put it up on the big screen and say,
you know, this is what's working,

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.571
this what isn't working,
this is what's kind of working.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.206
What that allows us to do is allocate

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.209
our resources based on our needs
for each class and each unit.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:21.181
So if we see that there's a C,
a red in one column, obviously

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.484
that means that we're going to need
some some support in that in that area.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.520
So we will allocate our resource teachers
myself as an AST

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.424
depending on the situation,
and make sure that those gaps get filled.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.328
It could also mean
it shows us what we're doing.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:35.795
Right.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:40.333
So if we have, a C of green,
that means, okay, our units are working.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.235
Let's move on to the next thing.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.237
Oftentimes
what happens is we get a lot of yellow.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:47.173
We get a lot of kids
who are pretty much there, but

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.810
they might need an extra
little boost for me as a AST.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.747
What that means is that I'm either
going to take those kids out, or I'm

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:58.485
going to sit with them in the classroom
and kind of reevaluate what we did right,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.255
what they missed,
and then I will try to fill that gap.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:08.228
As for that, yeah, hopefully by next year,
what we're trying to do is put together

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.664
physical copies of all of our data
that gets housed in teams

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:16.069
so that that can move on
to the next school that they graduate to.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.073
So in our case, we get them from grades
six, seven and eight.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.409
We're going to take all our pretest,
other post tests,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.447
all their demand writing,
all of their oral fluency, assessments.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.416
Everything that we get from them
is going to be housed in the binder

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.586
or to make copies of those
for the time they get to grade nine,

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.656
we can hand them all of their data.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.659
And that basically passes on the picture

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.929
to what what they're able to do
and what they what they can't do.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:43.630
Yeah.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.666
If you're starting to collect
data, start slow.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:51.070
Start with just just a pre
and a post test on a, on a unit

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.507
that you think that
is going to make some impact.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.343
So we pre and post test
a lot of things here.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.413
We you know, pretty much every month
we have

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.550
something that we're introducing
or trying to tighten up.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.985
But I would say just start with one unit.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.656
We like our first one that we did
was on capitalization.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.359
So we, we came up with the test
for capitalization.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.396
We pre tested them,
marked it a month later

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.732
after we taught the unit,
the post, tested them, we compared them.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.002
And then we got to see kind of
what the effect was of our teaching.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.705
Yeah. But I would definitely start slow.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.474
I would definitely, just
and as you go on now,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:32.445
like our capitalization unit is
the is the oldest one that we have.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:36.683
We've refined it 5 or 6 times since then
because we, we've we've seen

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.686
what the dad has told us about it,
what they didn't get, what they did get.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.689
So as you keep going,

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.459
you're going to stockpile
units, you're going to stockpile, data.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.494
And that's always just going to inform

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.231
how you're going to change things
or how you're going to keep things.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:51.431
Yeah.
