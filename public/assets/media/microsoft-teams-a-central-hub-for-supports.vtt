00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.310
Hi, I'm Breanna Saulnier.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.546
I'm, grade six to eight FI math teacher,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:18.084
as well as a vice principal of Port Elgin
Regional School here in New Brunswick.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.521
So I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about how

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.924
we have created a Microsoft teams site
in order

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.261
to be kind of our source of the truth
and a means of communication.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.098
This became light to due to the fact

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.467
that we've had surveys
sent out to the staff

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.804
at the end of the year,
asking us as leaders to improve

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.974
our communication styles
and methods and resources.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.345
So we thought, let's create
one place where, these documents

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.348
or conversations
or data pieces can be housed.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.185
Teachers, any A's, all have access to it.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.589
Minding confidentially clauses
and all that.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.560
And then they can use it
to fit their needs, whether it is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.231
to increase
their, knowledge in a subject area

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:10.403
in order to access social emotional
resources, in order to create a succession

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:14.340
plan amongst staff members
as our staffs are always changing.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.942
You have a teacher leave.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.778
They were the person that plan
great banquet or field day.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.814
Another gone. What do we do?

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.783
So we've been housing
all these resources on there.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.220
It's also allowing us
to build some teacher efficacy

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.790
not only in I'm a grade eight teacher.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.494
I need access to resources in grade one
because I have students

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:38.131
all across the board in my room
in math from 1 to 8.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.067
I'm definitely not an expert in elementary
math.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:44.003
I have great colleagues down at the other
end of our building that do.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.173
How do I get access
to their awesome resources?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.309
Implement it for my student in need?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.479
So we're developing that along
our journey.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:58.017
I'd say 5 to 8
when we're using it as a PLC hub

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:02.455
where we are creating documents
like building them together.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.691
So it's not one person
typing on the screen.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.092
Everybody's watching.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.594
People are pulling for the curriculum.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.995
They're pulling from resource links.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.031
They're pulling in different areas
to create this,

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:17.337
hub of access,

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:22.575
whether it's for whatever need you need it
to be in our earlier years, K to four,

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.246
we're starting to use it more in the field
trip area.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.150
We have some teachers
that are building some tools

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.152
or organizational things
for their classroom

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.354
that could be used in kindergarten
to grade eight.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:38.458
And their next steps are to increase
that academic input on their end.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:43.963
And one of our biggest achievements,
I think, for this is that

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:48.401
we now know, oh, if I need something
I'm going to go check there first.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:52.472
It's limiting the amount of looking for.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.641
I'm not sure where I put this.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.143
Access to different tools.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.912
Our school code of conduct.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.180
The latest version is up there.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.315
Somebody thinks we should change
something.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.816
You flag it in the document

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.953
when we bring it up,
the next time, it's there to discuss.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:10.089
So it's a live working platform

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.259
that has created open, honest dialog.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.597
If you're choosing to implement this,
however,

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.600
there's, one piece I would recommend,

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.870
taking time to figure out

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.307
is what is your main focus
for this tool in your building?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.344
Because when you create a Microsoft teams,
there will be 4 or 5 different options.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.013
If you're looking to have a turn
in section

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.983
where teachers can put their newsletters
as an administrator,

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.119
I'm not looking through 20 different
emails, 100 different emails.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.589
It's all right there in that drop box.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.458
Teachers
are then responsible to upload it there.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:51.064
It's creating a system within itself
in order to also alleviate

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:56.002
a little bit of the burden and that influx
in emails that are never ending.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.972
So other things we also use this

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:02.408
Microsoft Teams
for is housing house school data.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.778
We have a team member
who's created, classroom profile.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:10.016
Sheet where
how many students you have Plps.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.420
Where are they in regards to eg
where are they in regards to math facts?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.724
This can be uploaded there.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.692
K to eight. It's one document.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.929
So I know from year 1 to 2 to 3

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.332
to 4 how the students are progressing
the report cards.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.867
Great. It's a great snapshot.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.371
But if I'm looking at the specifics,
this has really allowed us to hone in

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.474
and focus
on what each child's next steps would be.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.378
Another thing I would recommend
is if you are going to implement

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.981
this is making use of the Pin feature.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.084
So if there's a document
you use all the time, for example,

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:48.054
or 5 to 18 would be our team PLC minutes.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.523
We have that pin to the top.
So it's an easy click.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.760
The minute you're in that team and
everything is right there that you need,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.697
you don't need to go through all the files
and figure out where the document is.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.634
Those every day,
every week uses are up there at the top.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:02.902
Easy to use.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.506
Good.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.073
Thank you.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:07.907
Yeah. Good.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:10.910
Okay. Yeah.
There were no wasted sentences.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.612
There was not repeated things.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:13.012
Okay.

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.615
You had all the things
that you were talking to you about. Yeah.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.786
You made the distinction between the team
and teams like Microsoft Teams.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.789
Yes.
You talked about your professional rigor.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.258
You know, the collaboration part of it.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:28.194
Yeah. Supporting each other. Next steps.

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.930
What it looks like. Yep.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.665
I think that's it. Yeah, yeah.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.867
And I think
you should feel good about that.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:37.704
Okay. Thank you.

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.406
And I think, honestly, it's
just from playing with it, right?

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:41.240
Like.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.677
So our next steps
would be to take some more time

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:48.014
with the K to 14,
figure out their purpose for it.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:54.554
Our 5 to 8 team needs to really increase
the rigor of using this tool.

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:59.225
We're doing it very well in relation
to our project based learning blocks.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:05.264
We may not been doing it as well
in areas for differentiation, for example.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:08.601
So there might be great tools out there
that can be used across the board,

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.673
different areas, but we're not using it
as a means to support

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.976
specific needs of students. Yet.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:20.113
That's one of our areas of growth
and focus for the upcoming school year.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:20.546
Next year.
