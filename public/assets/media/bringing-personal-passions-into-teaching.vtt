00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.743
My name is Mark Doucette, and

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.746
I'm a grade eight math teacher here
at Fundy Middle and High School.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.349
I'm here to talk about personal identity
to instructional approaches,

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.218
curriculum choices and student outcomes.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:21.388
How background of a teacher
would impact their teaching choices.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.325
And my examples would be,
for my my personal teaching.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.962
I teach math, but I also throw in bits
of financial literacy.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:33.800
Nutrition and fitness, based on
some of the numerical side of things.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:39.105
And also just to engage students in
some of real life, applicable, outcomes.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.108
Like they could, like,
use it right, right away

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.646
in terms of engagement,
this with specific groups of students,

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:50.417
like some kids who, I may not have
otherwise had a relationship with,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.420
if I had not started
some in the weight room stuff.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.754
That's kind of a nice thing.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:59.392
So I created a club out of it, and then,
some boys that need some movement,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:00:59.993
let's just say,

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.663
or some more, like rambunctious kids
that need to get that energy at lunchtime.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.432
They enjoy that stuff.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.934
And also the goal setting of it,
which is a different skill.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.904
So we're teaching it seems silly,
but when you're

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.772
trying to progress on like, say they're

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.576
trying to progress on a specific lift,
they need, where they need to set a goal.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.579
They need to do number
crunching percentages of those numbers.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.214
So I see benefits there.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:25.552
In terms of the financial literacy,
just some better money choices.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.555
They go home and have conversations with
their parents about their credit scores.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.989
How about a kid ask me, like, what?

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.191
Can you tell me, mom?

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.959
Like, my mom wants to know
what my credit score is.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.296
If my credit score is good,
and that's my it's like, expertise.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.197
And I was like, I.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.431
I think I could tell your mom

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.300
a good credit score, so I don't know,
you want to share that. Right.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.503
So it's like it's great you're going home
and having those conversations.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.972
And recently
I just started doing some nutrition stuff.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:51.344
And it's interesting to, to,
to really dive into, some what you,

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.047
what you assume kids know
about what they're eating

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.549
and then what
they actually know is very different.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.287
So, with those types of things that it's
there's numbers and it's math, but it's

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:05.592
also just they can pick it up and use it,
that knowledge almost like instantly.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.560
And then they and then become engaged.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.330
And that's kind of the key,
especially with math sometimes. Right.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.899
So I find it's less abstract,
more real life.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.501
And it works great.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.471
So advice for a teacher
who would like to, to like to use

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.673
their personal identities
and their instructional approaches

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.610
would be make sure it's something
that you really are passionate about.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.646
The kids can tell
whether it's something you're like,

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:30.617
doing like, like
something you're performing or something

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.152
you're really passionate about.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.555
So when, when I teach
and when I teach that stuff, I,

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.293
I feel like, I feel like it's a different
there's a different vibe.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.062
Let's say it's more
there is clearly more passion.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:46.432
And then when you figure out
what that is, it may seem

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:51.471
kind of strange at first to think about
what outcomes you can connect it to, but,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:54.974
once you get going,
you definitely can see it right away.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.045
And no matter what somebody you teach
la social science, math.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.847
Like, I have a music background.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.349
I could bring that into social. Like,
you can bring it.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.084
You can bring whatever you want into it.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.553
But the key is, I think it's

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.989
just make sure that's your passion
and it will just naturally happen.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.293
I think the purpose of bringing yourself
into is,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.696
is what we talk about engagement,
but also the relationship piece.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.067
It gets kids to see that,
knowledge can be powerful,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:25.271
even if it's like something, something
that they might not be interested in.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.408
Or maybe your your specific knowledge,
like at this school

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.411
in particular, we have a lot of,
sports players, a big sports school.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:35.815
So some of like my recently
we had a coffee house at the school.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.650
So my musical background was brought in

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.487
to attract some other students to kind of
let their light shine in a different way.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.257
So I think the

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:49.028
I think, the nice part about
is when every teacher say in a building

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:52.532
does that, then kids
have some, like someone to go to are they

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:56.035
have that champion sort of teacher
for them that they can relate to.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.106
And then it's just bring it's
just humanizing the teacher in a way

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:03.476
or bringing them closer to you with that,
an interest that you can share together.
