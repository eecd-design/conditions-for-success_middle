00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.976
laid out on the floor.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.611
It's very similar to Restorative Circle.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.079
Similar questions,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.349
but they just face each other
and they kind of move down the path.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.520
And like answering the questions,
sharing how they feel.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.823
And then when they get to the end of the
path, that's when they, same ideas.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.427
And so they come up with some like things
that they can do to resolve it,

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:32.232
and maybe they leave the circle
with a high five or a hug

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.137
or maybe they just walk away
and, say the differences.
