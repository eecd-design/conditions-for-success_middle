00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.978
Why? Universal
design for learning for UDL.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.281
Because every learner matters.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.852
UDL is a proactive approach
to lesson and assessment planning

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.689
that ensures all learners
can access learning from the start.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.058
Think of it like hosting a dinner party.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.394
As Doctor Katie Novak suggests.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.264
If you serve only tuna casserole,
you might discover

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:35.502
guests with dietary restrictions
like gluten, fish, dairy.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.105
You know what
if instead, at your next dinner party,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:43.610
it's a buffet of options
like make your own salad bar with protein

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.247
on the side, options for dressings
even have rice

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.850
in case someone wants to make a rice bowl
instead of a salad bowl.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.255
The goal is that everyone eats,
but the flexibility

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:59.092
of what they eat is proactively
and intentionally designed.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.029
UDL works the same way by anticipating

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.399
learner variability and barriers
the learner may encounter.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.237
You design flexible and accessible lessons
that meet diverse learning needs.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.774
Teachers with a UDL mindset often say

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.877
what's essential for some is beneficial
to all.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:23.316
By designing for inclusivity from
the start, you teach smarter, not harder.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.753
Minimizing stress
and avoiding last minute fixes.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:30.890
You proactively consider students
strengths and diverse social,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.694
emotional, cultural,
linguistic, and disability related

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.765
needs to create a learning environment
where everyone can thrive.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.801
This can be done in practice

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.337
by boosting engagement.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:49.142
Learners thrive when they have choices and
how they learn and show what they know.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.979
Valuing true inclusion.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.650
UDL empowers every learner,
not just accommodates them as a retrofit.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.854
Everyone values and embraces

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.424
learner variability and rediscovering joy.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:08.228
UDL brings creativity and purpose
back into your teaching

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.564
when setting clear and achievable goals.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.801
The goal of UDL is access to learning

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.770
and developing learner agency.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.106
Now, to implement UDL effectively,

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:23.109
we focus on the three core principles.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.013
Multiple means of engagement,
representation

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:30.984
in action and expression in instruction
and methods,

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:34.420
arterials assessments,
and in the learning environment.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.790
So let's break this down
with a few examples.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:43.596
Engagement is providing multiple options
that foster motivation, allowing learners

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:47.700
to connect to their interests
and identities to the learning process.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.572
This can mean offering choices in project
topics or collaborative group work,

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:56.109
nurturing a sense of belonging
and community.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.212
Representation is ensuring
that information

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.982
is presented in multiple formats,
so this could include

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:06.586
visual aids, audio resources,
or hands on activities.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.356
By doing so, we honor diverse perspectives

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:14.794
and enable every learner to access content
in ways that resonate with that.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.498
Finally, Action
and Expression is supporting learners

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.468
in demonstrating their understanding
through multiple avenues.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:27.073
Be it through writing,
oral presentations, or creative projects.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:31.211
This flexibility helps learners
express their unique voices

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.913
and displays
their strengths and their values.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.916
UDL isn't just good practice,

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.520
it's an essential part of inclusive
teaching and learning practices

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.124
in all English, Prime and French immersion
learning environments

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.828
from kindergarten to grade 12,
including middle school.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.765
By using the UDL approach,
we can break down barriers

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.968
that might hold students back.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.271
Whether those are social, emotional,
or academic,

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.307
UDL transforms classrooms

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.177
into spaces where every learner feel seen,

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:08.114
supported
and has agency over their own learning.
