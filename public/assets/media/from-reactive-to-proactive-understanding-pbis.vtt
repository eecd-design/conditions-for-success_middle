00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.243
Hello educators!

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.013
This video introduces positive behavior

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.016
interventions and supports PBIs.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.286
PBIs is not a program
or a good job pencil.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.621
It's a framework.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.624
This means it's
not something you add on to your day.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:29.162
Instead, it's a way of organizing
your school systems, practices,

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.600
and data to support positive behavior
and improve school climate.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.736
PBIs helps schools move

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.739
from reactive discipline
to proactive support.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:44.744
It's about teaching behavior the same way
we teach academics through modeling,

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.714
practice, feedback and reinforcement

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.617
to implement PBIs with fidelity.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.620
Schools focus on 12 essential elements.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:57.957
These elements help schools
build a strong foundation of processes

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:02.429
and procedures, and ensures
PBIs is not just a set of posters

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.565
or rewards,
but a meaningful part of school culture.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.703
PBIs supports every learner,
not just those with behavioral challenges.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.541
It's designed to be inclusive, equitable,
and responsive

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.544
to the diverse needs of students
in New Brunswick schools.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:21.181
Implementing this framework helps
to foster a more positive

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.350
learning and working environment
for students and staff.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.888
This support students
to feel seen, supported and successful

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.724
when school community consistently

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.595
support students to understand
and meet behavioral expectations.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.300
They are better able to focus on
learning and achieving academic success

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:45.839
when school wide expectations
and consequences are clear and consistent.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.242
Students
feel safe in their learning environments.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:53.046
This results in improved academic
and social emotional growth.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.918
According to Doctor
Jessica Cibrian, Hannigan and Doctor

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.755
Linda Hauser,
authors of the PBIs tier one Handbook,

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:07.460
the old way of doing business to address
student behavior is not working.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.630
We can no longer accept or afford the wait

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.633
to fail
or wait to misbehave model of behavior.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.902
We must be proactive.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.905
Effective PBIs implementation includes

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.876
defining clear behavioral expectations
for all students,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.879
staff, and school
community across all settings.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:31.818
Explicitly teaching those expectations,
reinforcing positive behavior

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.622
consistently and meaningfully, using data

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.625
to guide decisions and monitor progress.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:43.763
Responding to misbehavior with support
and instruction, not just consequences.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.300
Empowering staff
with professional learning

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.036
based on a school's unique needs.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.039
PBIs is not about fixing students.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.242
It's about building systems
that help everyone succeed.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:00.380
It's a journey of growth,
reflection, and collaboration.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:05.218
Thank you for your commitment
to creating safe, inclusive schools.
