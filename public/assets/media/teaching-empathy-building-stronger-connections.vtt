00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.977
Hello, middle school educators.

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.747
Let's take a few minutes
to talk about teaching empathy

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.750
and why it matters for students and school
culture.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.421
Empathy is the ability to understand
and share the feelings of others.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.326
Teaching empathy intentionally
helps students navigate relationships,

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:30.163
solve problems, and feel
connected to their school community.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.000
It starts with leadership,
modeling empathy.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.237
When leaders recognize staff
efforts, provide

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.874
emotional support, and show understanding
and daily interactions.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.044
It sets the tone for the entire school.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:44.844
Staff can then

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.481
look for intentional opportunities
to teach empathy within the curriculum,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.918
demonstrating that caring for others
is a core part of learning.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.922
One classroom activity
that can teach empathy

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.925
and can be incorporated
into any learning area

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.694
is an activity called Four Corners.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.465
This activity is found in the Castle
CEO three

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.702
Signatures Playbook,
which can be found online@castle.org.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.771
An example of

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.842
using the four corners activity
in a middle school music class would be to

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.946
place four different genres of music,
or four different musical artists,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.183
in each of the four corners
of your classroom.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.553
Then, ask students
to walk around to each corner

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:29.856
and choose the genre or artist
they prefer to listen to.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.394
You will likely find that students will
divide themselves into the four corners.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:38.598
The next step is for students
to discuss and validate with other peers

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:43.236
why they chose the same corner,
why they chose that genre or artist.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:47.640
It could be because the type of music
reminds them of memories of a grandmother,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.111
or they were listening to this artist
during their first kiss.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.812
Who knows?

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.115
Students are likely
to learn more about each other

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.118
and feel a sense
of belonging in that group.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.153
The next step is where empathy comes in.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:01.754
It is

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.291
all in teaching students that it's okay
to have different preferences.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.194
In this case, music.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:12.132
The teacher can prepare students
how to be good, active listeners

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.435
and be open to hearing other perspectives.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.740
When a student from one corner shares
their experience and other students

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.378
from other corners can accept, appreciate
and celebrate these differences,

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:28.648
we can create a caring
and empathetic environment.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.218
This activity can also be done in language
arts.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.156
By choosing four different novels
or four characters from the same novel,

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.360
or for periods of time
in history and social settings,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.797
whatever learning area you teach,
you can incorporate this

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.867
Four Corners activity
to help teach empathy skills

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.870
in your classroom.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.938
Teaching empathy

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.841
doesn't mean lowering expectations.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.644
In fact, it strengthens them

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:02.482
when we model care while holding
students accountable for positive behavior

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:07.687
and academic effort, we show that empathy
and high standards go hand in hand.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.657
Students learn

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.626
that they are capable of both kindness
and excellence,

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:17.730
and that meeting expectations is a part
of honoring themselves and others.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.802
Practices and routines that reinforce
empathy are key.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.773
Restorative circles or classroom meetings
at the middle level can help

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.976
students explore
different perspectives and solve problems.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.379
Peer support groups or mentorship programs

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.282
build mutual care
among staff and students.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:41.087
Embedding these practices makes empathy
a lived experience, not just a lesson.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.424
By intentionally teaching empathy,

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:48.228
modeling in our interactions,
and embedding it in our school culture.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.464
We help students develop social,
emotional skills,

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.801
feel valued, and contribute
positively to their community.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.339
Thank you for creating a school
where empathy guides

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.475
interactions, decisions,
and learning every day.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.246
Your efforts
help students grow, connect, and thrive.
