Hi, I'm Tyler

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.112
Yost, one of the vice principals here
at Fundy Middle and High School.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.249
One of the things that we do here
at Fundy Middle and High School

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:21.354
is we work with our district partners
and leaders and making sure that our staff

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.759
are continually getting updates
on best practices and ways that they can

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.963
improve their classroom environment
to best suit the needs of our students.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.033
I think being trauma informed is more than

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.302
just understanding that kids
come into our building with trauma.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.205
It's about understanding
what makes them tick

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.275
and how we respond to their needs
when they come into our building.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.712
We know that students come to us
with adverse childhood experiences,

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.516
and that may impact how they behave
or operate within our building.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.917
And as a staff, it's important

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:55.021
that we are able to not make assumptions
of who these people are.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.559
We don't know necessarily
everyone's entire story, so it's important

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.495
in order to be inclusive,
that we are considering all students

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.598
and shaping our environment
and a response in a way

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.501
that would be suitable
for as many students as possible.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.172
I would say to gain traction
in trauma informed practices.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.809
It requires continual
learning and discussion and updates.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:20.547
And as administrators, being able
to to debrief on behavioral incidents

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.616
and tie that into to the behavior
where possible.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.986
One of the best ways that we can be
trauma informed in

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.490
our building is not making assumptions
about who's walking into our door.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.159
So assuming that all students are impacted
in some way

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.162
and not expecting every student
to share their story

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.699
and what they've gone through,
either in years past or on the very day of

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.568
when they're walking into our building.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.802
So we encourage teachers

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.772
to be kind and welcoming
when when students enter the classroom,

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.409
and to be curious
when we see behaviors that don't align

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.813
with how we would see a student
on a typical day, to be curious

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.182
and to see how we can support
and remove barriers

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.085
and keep them active and engaged
in that school.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.855
I would say, especially in years past,
when we see problem

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.358
behavior, educators would be quick
to remove students from classrooms

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:09.963
and even even from school,
through disciplinary measures

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:14.334
and being curious and trauma
informed addresses the root of the issue.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:18.204
Rather than seeing the child
as the problem and removing them.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.672
We want to remove barriers

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.876
and come to a point of understanding
so that students can succeed.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.346
I would say we know that
we're being successful

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.615
by measuring
how long students are in class,

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.683
and we know that when they're in class,
they're learning.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.285
And that's a great measure of success.
