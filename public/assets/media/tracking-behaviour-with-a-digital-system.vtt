Hi. My name is Judson Way.e

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.146
I'm principal of Doctor Losier
Middle School in Miramichi New Brunswick.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.681
And I'm going to talk to

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.752
you guys about my behavior tracking forms
and my incident management system.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.956
So today, my, behavior
tracking system is a QR code.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.359
It's a digital system
where teachers enter all the data

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.429
that would be required
for an incident, manage referral.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.698
They enter that into a survey,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.801
which triggers an email
that comes to administrators.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.170
We're able to see what the concerns are.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.408
In real time, we're able to intervene
with the child, and we're also able

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.978
to give feedback back to the staff member
who put in the referral,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.582
in a timely manner so they know, what
actions were taken by the administration

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.553
The big needs, to get to
that is we're a PBIs school

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.657
and part of the PBIs framework is
to analyze your data on a regular basis.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:02.996
We take a look at our attendance
and our incident management data.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.699
And all of our behavior data
on a weekly basis at ESD.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.969
So, we needed to have a system that was,

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.707
that was a simple and able to pull,
not only our behavior

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.945
not tolerated our serious misconduct,
but also the different PBIs interventions

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.081
that we would have going on in the school.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.384
So we could pull that on a weekly basis
to make more informed decisions.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:28.855
the biggest, tip
that I would make to any administrator

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.958
would be to have some kind of,
a digital system.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.128
It's just too labor
intensive to have a piece of paper.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.099
If you're looking to analyze
data, really at any point,

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.300
whether that's weekly,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.804
or even just monthly, it just becomes
a lot of pieces of paper that you're going

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:49.109
to have to manually import into something
to try and analyze that data.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.078
So if you can already have it
in a digital format to start with,

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.280
it's just going to save
you a lot more time. If you
