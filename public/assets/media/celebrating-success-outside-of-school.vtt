00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.876
So my name is Heather Dickson,

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.879
and I'm the principal at Marshview
Middle School in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.647
And today, I wanted to talk to you

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.917
about how we celebrate student successes
here in our building.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.655
So for school successes,
we have recognition assemblies.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.992
And we do student
shout outs on the announcements.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.863
But we also recognize that students
have a life outside of school.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:35.268
So we created a sense of community
where we want to recognize their successes

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.938
outside of the building, whether that's
through music, through their athletics,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.774
etc.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.276
whatever activity that they like to do.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.413
We reached out to parents in September,

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.816
and we say that,
if there's something going on

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.053
we want to know about,
we want to celebrate it with the students.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:57.290
Often that they will email in
about their latest hockey win,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.294
about their successes in the pool
or in their music competitions.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:05.265
We add those to a weekly newsletter
that we send home to the parents,

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.902
and make sure that the whole school
knows that

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.205
they've had a successful night
on the field court, etc..

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.541
We do this to create a sense

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.378
of belonging here at our school
and really to foster community.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:23.216
So we have the swim coach
that emails me at the end of the races.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:26.786
The music teachers that will say, hey,
my student was really successful

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:27.720
on the weekend.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.122
So it's that back and forth

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.625
and really creating that open dialog
with our community members

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.196
to ensure that we're,
celebrating the successes of our kids.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.934
tips and tricks that I would have
if you would like to do this at

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.138
your school is to create the open dialog
and to create a relationship

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:49.242
with the family so that you have,
everyone says it takes a village

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.310
to raise the kids.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.714
And so to have that open dialog
where people are reaching out

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:59.185
and, we're celebrating with the kids
in all facets of their life.
