00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.409
So, hi.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.645
My name is Sadie Chantler,
I'm the late French immersion teacher

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.615
for grades six to grade
eight at Port Elgin Regional School.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.283
Today, I will be talking to you

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.687
about the student feedback forms
that we complete once per term.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.923
We call them at our school
start stop continues.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:28.695
The form itself
looks like a very simple table

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.997
with three different categories
or three different columns.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.200
One of them says start, the other one
says stop, and the last one says continue.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.469
Students are expected to fill in.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.739
At least one thing
for each of those categories.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.576
Talking about the classroom practices
and the teacher practices for their room.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.580
For whoever teacher,
whatever teacher distributes the form.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:53.353
In practice, it looks like talking to
students about them

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.356
having a voice and the opportunity
to affect what happens.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.659
What their teacher does,
the types of activities that they do,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.362
the things that they want more
or less of a focus on.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.465
And students are able to fill those out.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.700
Usually right after report cards, season

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.070
after they've gotten a whole bunch
of feedback on what they're doing,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.138
they're able to give feedback
to their teacher.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:17.544
And then that teacher looks at the forms
and creates a separate document,

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.547
typically a cue card or a post-it note,
something very small.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.816
With the things that come up a lot.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:27.153
So if I were to fill them out
and I saw that six kids told me they need

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.256
more physical brain breaks,
then I'm going to start adding more

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.259
physical brain
breaks into my classroom practice.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.130
Or if I have seven kids that tell me
they really want more fantasy books

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.135
in the classroom, the next time
I have more, funds to purchase books, I'm

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.105
going to start looking for fantasy books
that are available to them.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.942
So I find it a really valuable tool
to help me understand

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.444
what my kids want
and really give them the opportunity

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.480
to have voice and choice
in their learning environment.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.617
Some tips.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.054
Something that I've noticed happens,
a lot is very helpful

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:05.625
to know is, it's important to front load
and tell the students

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.761
why they are doing this
and what is actually possible for them

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.931
to change and how their voice can be used
during this activity.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:15.168
I find if you give the kids the form
and don't give them

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:19.072
the background knowledge,
you get a lot of, feedback

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:23.009
that says, I don't want to do math or,
we should stop getting homework.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.945
We should. For my case,
I'm the French teacher, so I get a lot of.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.848
We should start
speaking more English in class.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.851
And if you front load it
and you tell them,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.988
here are the things that I have to do
and I cannot change.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:39.025
But it's important to think about things
that I really can change

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.027
and that you really think
would be valuable

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:44.030
for your education
or for the way that you learn.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.033
This is your opportunity to have a voice
and change in effect, those things.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.136
I find the feedback that you get
is a lot more valuable that way.
