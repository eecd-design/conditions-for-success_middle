Hi my name is Jaime Hunter.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.314
I'm the music specialist
at Birchmount School, and I'm here

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:18.284
to speak to you about what
it can look like in your schools

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.988
to implement some student performances,
and showcasing

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.991
what they're learning is.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.660
So in my project,
looking at virtual school

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.964
exclusively music,
I'm one component of three teams

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.334
music, art and life skills.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.971
And together we create a creative showcase

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.341
to showcase the work of our students.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.411
We've worked with a few different formats
and this is definitely still

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.311
in development.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.314
We really want to get this right,
and so we're moving

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.317
to our third term
with the creative showcases.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:57.424
At first looked like small groups
rotating, sharing their music, watching,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.797
the live skills being demonstrated
and then observing art within the school.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.632
Interim two.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.135
We had everyone together
watching the music performances.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.373
We then had everyone go and see that,
displays of the life skills.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.207
And then we had everyone

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.710
finished with the art and going
and seeing it in a gallery style.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.448
We are working towards having parents
and guardians

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.451
and community members
come on in and see that too,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.421
but we're open to seeing
what that looks like, taking what we like

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.058
from previous showcases and saying, okay,
what can we do better here?

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:32.625
And then

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.596
maybe ditching some stuff that didn't work
to showcase our students at their best?

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.565
It could be timeline.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.702
It could be how many students
are in the same space together.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:48.007
It could be moving towards maybe students
not having to watch each other's work

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.977
and let that be for our community
and school members too.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.546
We don't know yet,
but we're looking forward to figuring out

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.381
what works
best for our students along the way.
