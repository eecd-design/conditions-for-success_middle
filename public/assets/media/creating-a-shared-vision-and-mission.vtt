00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.876
Hi, my name is Sacha Koumbias.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.978
I'm the principal of River Valley
Middle School.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.882
Today, I'd like to talk about our journey
to create a new vision

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.219
and mission for our school,
as well as our values.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:23.623
And so the journey started
about three years ago,

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.326
and we took our time

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.662
because we really wanted it
to be something we really believed in.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:34.367
And so we talked a lot about the vision
being a promise to our students

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.769
and our community.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.672
And so in order to uphold that promise,
we really had to believe it.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.373
We had to live it.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.977
We wanted to really feel
that it was something we could do.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.847
And so we really started basically

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.284
just by talking about
what we really believe about education.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:54.454
And as a staff,
we tried to find some common

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.457
things that we shared,
some common philosophies.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.827
So even just to begin,
we just talked about our favorite teacher

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.363
and how that teacher made us feel.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.466
And that kind of grounded our work
because we wanted to go back

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.837
to those feelings about what we felt
when we talked about our favorite teacher.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.641
And so we also tried to involve our

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.644
community
as much as possible during open houses.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:22.949
We asked parents what they wanted to see
when their kids left River Valley.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:28.521
We asked our home and school and our PSC
to answer a couple of questions for us.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.559
One question was, what do you believe
the purpose of education is?

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.862
And the second question
was when your child leaves

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:39.632
River Valley Middle School,
what knowledge, skills, and characters

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.168
do you hope they possess?

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:46.973
And so then, in all of our subsequent
professional learning days,

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.910
we really talked about what does a vision
and mission statement mean?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.445
What does it look like?

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.216
We did some readings on that
and then and small groups.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:00.153
We came together and we started to draft
what we really felt.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:05.492
And then we took those drafts
and we looked for themes, and we combined

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:10.196
the themes to come up with what
we now have as a vision and mission.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.865
And statement.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.235
And we also have five values
that we strive to live by.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.771
And we're now in the implementing stages.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.509
So we've taken three years
to come up with this vision and mission

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.843
and value statement.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:28.648
And now we are implementing them
into our our daily routine.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.887
So one take away
would be the importance of being patient

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:38.091
and taking your time to really build on
what your staff believe.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:43.029
And, every school is unique,
so it's important

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:48.268
that you really try to identify
your school strengths and really,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.804
reflect, have those

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:55.241
strengths reflected in your statements,
in your vision and mission statements.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.511
And, looking ahead.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.182
We really trying to find ways now
to embed this

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.251
into the fabric of our school
and to ensure that the decisions

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:09.222
that we're making for our students
are reflective of our vision and mission.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.993
The vision and mission really are
something that should anchor your school,

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.061
and they should align

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.531
with your school improvement plan
and the district improvement plan.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.901
And so you have to have
that big overarching goal,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:26.506
that big overarching targets
that you're always working towards.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.609
And so, you know, having that vision
and mission keeps us

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.946
aligned and, and reminds us
of what we have promised to do.
