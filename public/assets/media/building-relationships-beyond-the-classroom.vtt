00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.776
My name's Joe Kaye.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.611
I work at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.546
I'm the custodian there.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.715
Yeah.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.551
Today, I'm going to talk to you about,

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.521
students and staff relationship.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.024
Within the school.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.092
The relationship with me
and the students in

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:29.095
the school is,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.866
is a little bit different, I would say,
than what it is for a lot of custodians.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.002
I got a very,

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.505
I'm. I relate to them
on a very personal level.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.108
And, I work with the kids quite a bit.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.545
They, they come down and give me a hand
all the time.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:50.050
They're they're constantly asked them
to get out, to come and give me a hand.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.586
So it's, it's a lot of, hands on

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.589
working with the kids and,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.993
just spend quality time with them,
I guess.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:04.397
So some of the stuff that, I do with
the kids would be like, at during

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.268
lunch hour, there's a group of usually 5
or 6 kids that come down every day.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.572
They're just eager to give me a hand
every day.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:17.110
So we, we have our, like,
15 minute lunch period, and,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.346
then we just get straight to work
and they're all like, just

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.783
they can't wait to get out
and get something done.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.152
That's all they want to do. They want
something to do with their hands.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.321
They want to
they want to work and stay busy.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.857
That's that's 15 minutes is all
they need to eat their lunch.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.359
And if you give them any more than that,
they're in trouble.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.528
And they, they just they want to work.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:41.034
So For example, one of the,
like one of the many benefits that

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:46.172
I find comes of, working with the kids
so much as it, it, it gives them,

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.374
a little bit more of a

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.811
reason to want to come to school,
something to look forward to.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:56.082
For example, there's a, young fellow
here at the school.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.652
He works with me almost every day.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:03.890
It doesn't matter whether he's
feeling down or doesn't want to do it.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.692
He still comes down and he's there.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.560
I can count on to be there every day.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.496
And, his father owns

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.732
a local business here in town,
and I was talking with him one morning

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.203
and he said, keep doing what you're doing
because my son doesn't come home and say,

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.707
I did this with so-and-so at lunch,
or I did this for so-and-so.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.644
He says, today at, lunch, I was doing
this with Joe and this with Joe.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.980
He says,
so you keep doing what you're doing here.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.948
So I'm not saying
you're keeping them in school,

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.451
but he said, you're giving up something
to look forward to.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:36.055
So One of the many benefits
is also for myself, because it leaves me

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.392
going home feeling a lot
better about myself every day.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.562
I can come in here
and be having the worst more in the world.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:47.667
And there's like, usually, usually by 9:00
in the morning, there's like three kids

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.937
that have said, I, I, you're the best,
you know, the best teacher in the school.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.072
You're the best employee not employee.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:57.477
But they that's they always say teacher
the best at all in the school.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.612
Like every morning never fails.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:03.683
There's always some kid saying it, and
and it just makes you feel good, I guess.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:08.454
So As, as, like a final comment,
I guess I'd say is, one thing

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.490
a lot of people don't realize is the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.494
the staff reaches out a lot further
than just the teachers in the school.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:20.600
The, the I myself didn't realize that
before I started working

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.334
within the school.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:25.838
And my first probably two years,
I didn't implement this,

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.945
System, I guess that I have going

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.782
I didn't work with the kids nearly
as much, and I wish that I would have,

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.851
because the the last five years
that I've been working with the district

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.719
has flew by.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.589
And, I love working at Mark two.
It's a great school.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.290
The kids make it even better.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.862
They've just, And one more proven
point to me that the staff is a lot

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.932
more than just the teachers at the school,
because they make it worthwhile going to

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.666
the school every day.
