WEBVTT

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.409
So, hi, I'm Kim

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.912
Beckerleg and a behavior intervention
mentor here at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.948
And I'm going to be talking today

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.518
about how we teach the code
of conduct here at our school.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:24.457
So us together, as in the team,
we have created some rules for the school.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.192
And the beginning of the year,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.562
we will go around the different classrooms
and teach what those rules are

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:34.434
and what will happen if one of those
expectations is not quite that.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.338
And we have
it posted where the students can see it

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.142
and can be reminded of what the different
expectations are for our school.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.611
So it's right up there
in the front of the school.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:50.083
And the way that we are trying
to remind the students of where they are

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.454
at with regards to those expectations
is that we have universally, across

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:58.525
the school, tried to set up a system
so that the kids know

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.295
where their boundaries are with the
teachers, because different teachers

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.030
are going to have different boundaries.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.865
So when they go into a class,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.903
we have the one, two, three, four system
we call it in the school.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.138
That will sort of
let the kids know where they're at.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.442
So we teach them that
if there is a behavior

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.445
that is not quite meeting
one of those expectations or rules,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.980
then we're going to redirect them
one time.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.916
We'll redirect them a second time,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.985
and then we'll talk to them outside
in the hall, privately, away

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.988
from the other students who are
in the class, away from the peer pressure,

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.459
where we can have
just a really honest conversation

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.795
to see if there's something
that that student needs in that moment.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.032
Maybe they need to move,
maybe they need to go for a walk.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.667
Maybe they just need a break.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.036
And we can also share
what our expectations are

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.506
in that classroom again, because maybe
there's one little tweak to the behavior

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:50.443
that might make things a little bit
more easy going in the classroom.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.280
And if they're not quite able
to return back to class,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.448
or if they go back to class

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.550
and they're still not meeting
that expectation,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.586
then we can find a quiet place
where they can work.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.188
If they're not ready to be
in that learning environment.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.191
So for myself,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.461
we we as an SS team,

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:12.565
we've set up what the code of conduct is
and we're able to send

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.700
that home to the parents,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.936
and they can see what the expectations
are, and they can also see

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.073
what the response to school
is going to take at the different levels.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.309
So for small things like a kid
removing their hood.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.145
Well, we'll redirect it.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.548
And sometimes it'll be ignore
the their behavior.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.750
If it's a small thing.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.651
And then at some point,

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.421
if it's a regular thing
that happens on a daily basis, well,

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.657
then maybe there'll be a phone
call home as well,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.392
when sometimes
if there's a bigger behavior

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:43.029
that's happening,
the students will often be sent to me

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:46.766
for a little school lesson
that we can tailor to what the need is.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.670
So if we're dealing with respect towards
an authority figure, well,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.839
we might look at what that looks like.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.676
What the expectation is,
because it's not necessarily just kindness

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.845
towards the teacher or liking the teacher.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.981
Sometimes it's just doing what the teacher
needs you to in those moments.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:06.386
So we will find a lesson
that so that tailors to that need.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.590
And it also lets
the parents know where the line is to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.392
if they need to step out of that

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.361
learning environment
for a longer period of time, as well.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.530
we put this into place?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.900
Because when I first came into the school
as behavior mentor,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.036
I was noticing that
when I would talk to kids

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.939
who were out of class
or who were sent towards the office,

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.541
they often didn't know why
they were there.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.845
So when I would talk to them
or when I would observe things going on,

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.848
I would see that there was a redirection
or redirection or redirection,

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.585
random numbers of redirections.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.120
And eventually
the teachers had had enough,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.123
but the students
didn't know where the line was.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.359
So they get redirected a lot.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.062
But then at some point it was just
too much and they would be out.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.297
So this way
we've kind of set that boundary for them,

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.399
and the teachers
can set their own boundaries.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.336
Because some teachers
like having more energy in the classroom

00:03:56.336 --> 00:04:00.039
and more,
more engagement in their lessons.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.009
And kids calling out is okay
in their class and other teachers.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.012
They need to set stricter boundaries
because they can't concentrate

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:09.148
and keep their train of thought going
so they can have stricter boundaries.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.918
But it lets the teachers
share with the students

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.720
where that boundary is for them.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.557
And so that way they can go up to the edge
without necessarily crossing the line.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.361
one of the things or a few of the things
that I can suggest to teachers

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.496
when they're doing it is, first of all,

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.632
we can do it really quietly
and really respectfully.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:29.269
I sometimes run by a desk and
just a little tap and show them my finger.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:33.006
Just one finger to show them that,
okay, that's one do redirection.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.040
It's a little bit too much.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.844
And I like that because I can still be
teaching and still talking to the class

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.846
without having to stop what I'm doing,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.315
and without calling that student out
in front of everybody.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.517
It can be very discreet and very quiet.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.287
For some kids,
I just have a little visual,

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.290
a little visual check
that I use with them.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.557
So I have one student.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:55.128
I'll touch my nose, and they know that
that's that's the key for them,

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.964
because they're not wanting anybody
to show a one,

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.133
because other students
might know what that means.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.136
So we can organize it
so that it fits each student

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.538
with what's going to work
for the classroom.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:06.973
And I also find,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.676
because I'm not up in the classroom
and I'm not doing it regularly.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.546
Sometimes it's good to have a few plans
of how I'm going to implement it,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.348
because just walking into a classroom

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:18.184
and saying you're going to do
it is not as simple as necessarily

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.421
knowing what exactly you're going to use.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:25.525
So and I often share that with the kids
because, again, that predictability

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:29.629
of what they should expect is really
important for them to know what's coming.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.499
So I, I find the most useful ways is,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.470
is that I'll go in and I'll tell the class
what my biggest challenges.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.306
So for myself,
when I'm teaching in the classroom,

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:43.776
when I call out or ask kids
to give out an answer

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.678
and somebody gives me a silly answer,

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:50.316
that's taking my lesson
completely in a different direction.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.585
I will give them a one for that.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:55.254
And I'll also tell them
that if the group starts

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:58.257
working on something
in, the noise level bubbles up too much

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:02.762
and I have to redirect the whole class
that I'll often look for the first student

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.765
who starts talking afterwards,
and that student will get a one.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.333
And that way I have two moments

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:10.536
where I can take a breath,
and I can easily use that system.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.038
And I've worked

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.074
with a couple of different teachers
to try to help them to find their own

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.443
little moments
of where their boundaries are,

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.446
and what are the things that are most
challenging for them in their classes.

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:24.250
And we have a plan ahead of time
about how to deal with that in the moment.

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:28.855
So sometimes we've had to go back
the next day and look at is that working?

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:32.125
And maybe come in with a new plan
the next day, but

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.895
we just keep tweaking it until they help
find their groove and make it work.
