00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.411
Hi. My name is Ashley Baisley.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.414
I'm a teacher at Birchmount School,
and I'm going to talk

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.417
a little bit
about my experiential learning.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.822
So I teach math most of the day,
but in the afternoons,

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.825
I've got this block of time
where I'm able to do

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.260
some really cool things with the kids.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.662
We have what's called life skills, math.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:34.901
And, at our school, we get to go
into the kitchen and do math, hands on.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.404
So that's reading recipes.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:42.142
Learning about ratios real time
when you're making, you know, bannock,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:47.914
doing timing and sequencing,
learning about temperatures and,

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:53.420
and all kinds of hands on life things that
we do in daily life that involve math.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.991
Learning about fractions,
using measuring cups, learning about,

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.261
having and doubling recipes,
where you're having

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.365
and doubling fractions, what to do
if you don't have the right measuring cup

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.668
for the volume of flour that you need?

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.338
Just those kinds of skills
there, learning that hands on.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.641
And it's really making that connection
between that number

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.276
that they see on a page.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.447
And really what that fraction means,
they're able to see like that.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.950
An eight is smaller than a quarter
because they're seeing it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.519
and they're like, oh, well,
I always thought it was bigger

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.521
because eight on the bottom
is bigger than four.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.824
And then they're just like
they're making those connections

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.827
and they're seeing I'm seeing I'm
seeing the light bulb come on.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:38.698
And it's made a big difference
in their their acceptance

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:39.833
of like sometimes when kids

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.435
when they see a fraction on a page, they,
they shut it down.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.870
They're like, I can't do a fraction.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.173
But now they're more open to doing it
in math class because it's like, oh, well,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.242
that's just like a measuring cup for
that's just like,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.811
I've seen this,
I know this, I can do this.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.280
So we've had a lot of wins with that.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.551
I've also got to do some really cool
things, with sewing and budgeting.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.820
And they're learning about like,
comparative shopping

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.124
and like breaking down
unit costs of things to get a better deal.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.394
So it's just I hope it's
going to make those kids in that,

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.932
that typically don't enjoy math class,
see that there is value in it.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.902
And I see them now
telling me they're like,

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.570
oh, well,
I was going to buy this at the store.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.607
And then I realized, like, if I got
if I just bought the case of them,

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:24.711
Madame, it's so much cheaper to do it
that way, and I have more of them to go.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.514
It cost a little bit in the beginning,
more cost more in the beginning.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.649
But I'm going to have more and save money.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.852
So I'm just seeing them
make those connections in their real life.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.256
And they're talking about going
grocery shopping and looking at the, the,

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.324
the prices per volume.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:42.095
So it's really cool to see that and have
those conversations with middle schoolers.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.865
How did we get here?

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.300
How did I start doing this?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.639
I guess,
was it all started when I was, started

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.209
doing some hydroponics in my classroom,
and we grew lettuce

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.381
and and it was really cool because we got
to chart the lettuce like the nutrients.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:05.351
They got to learn about all that
and get hands on, and then I said,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.720
oh, no, no, now I gotta do something
with all of this lettuce.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.221
Like, at first

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.591
I was trying to get them to take it home
and then I was like, maybe I can sell it.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.160
But then I was like,
no, we need to do something.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.429
We need to, like, do something,
maybe feed the school.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.599
And I ended up applying for a grant
and got a little bit of money,

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.701
from the farm to cafeteria.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.469
And I got to make it bigger and better.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.771
And then we were able to produce,

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.774
like, a whole bunch of lettuce,
like 200 heads of lettuce out of time.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.076
And then we were able to do some

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:33.813
really cool things
with pretending like we were a restaurant

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:38.718
and making Caesar salads from scratch,
and the kids got to make croutons.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.353
They got to wash lettuce.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.022
We ran it
kind of like a kitchen at a restaurant.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:47.093
They had servers, they got food runners,
and they all got to experience that.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:49.729
And they all had a job
and they thought it was really fun.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.865
And my administrators at the time, they,
they started to see

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:53.866
like, okay, there's like

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.469
there's value in doing stuff like this.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.137
Like this is the kids are engaged.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.073
Like some of the kids,
you would sit there with their arms

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.042
crossed
and not participating were like into it.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.378
And they were loving it.
And you can see the light in their eyes.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:06.546
They're excited to come to class.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.147
So that's where we were able

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:11.884
to see, like making time in my schedule
on the day that I could do this

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:16.589
in class on a daily basis or weekly basis,
and make it part of their daily

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:21.961
of the math curriculum
and connecting those those anecdotal

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:25.231
and those like abstract ideas
to to real life things.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:28.234
It really made that connection
for those kids

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.971
and brought in a lot of more fun
and enjoyment and made them

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.275
participate more,
and just made my day more fun to.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.279
So if,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.082
like tips for if you were trying
to wanting to take on something

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:46.119
like make more of experiential learning
in your day.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.388
There's lots of grants out there.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.522
Spray mental learning.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:52.258
You can get a lot of different grants.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:55.261
There's a lot of people
wanting to invest in,

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.899
in youth and in experiential learning,
in particular with youth.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:04.103
And if you're creative and you can connect
things, anything to math, especially,

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.340
you can definitely get some money
to help you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.576
make this idea and any idea
that you have come to fruition.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:14.514
And, talking to your administrator
and, and, and,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.784
and coming up with a plan and,
and sharing the ideas

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:22.922
and getting other people excited
and on board is really what kind of gets

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:26.793
you gets the team behind you
and can make really amazing things happen.
