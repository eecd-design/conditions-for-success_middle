00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.109
So my

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.979
name is Whitney
Beals, and I am the educational support

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.216
teacher for English
as an additional language at Dr.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.784
Losier Middle School.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.755
And today, I'm here to talk about the ways
that we train

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:26.159
and educate both our staff
and our students on identity

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.597
related issues,
such as culturally responsive pedagogy.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.436
Implicit bias and anti-racist training.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.640
So one of the ways that we do
this is by offering

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.977
professional learning opportunities
to our staff members.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.981
So recently
I teamed up with another staff member

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:53.620
to present on implicit Bias
and culturally responsive pedagogy.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.990
And she took over the implicit
bias portion

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.993
of the presentation
and then handed it over to me

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.496
so that I could talk about
culturally responsive pedagogy.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.735
And our school actually decided
that they wanted to, adopt

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.872
that as one of our,
our, school improvement goals.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:17.577
And so now it's incorporated
into our school improvement goal

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.981
to make sure that we're using
culturally responsive teaching practices

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:27.320
to help students feel safer
and to get the most out of their learning.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.523
In terms of the students.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:34.060
We recently, unfortunately recognized

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.730
well and unfortunate that we recognized,
but unfortunate that it's an issue.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.634
But we recognize that there is an issue

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:46.172
of the language that students are using
when talking about race,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:49.342
and about using discriminatory language.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.812
And this was found in our behavior
tracking data that we have.

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:57.050
And so once we found that
this was an issue, we had a meeting.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.486
So I met with our behavior mentor.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:03.056
And I met also with our principal,

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.092
and we discussed
what is our action plan going to be.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:12.265
So we try to think about what's the first
step in making sure this never happens.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.268
And we decided that education was the best
first step

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.438
because we can't punish students
if they don't know that

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.006
what they're doing is wrong.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.310
And so we decided
that I would be teaming up with teachers

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.047
to create unit plans
that would address these issues.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.482
And so that's what we did.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:34.120
I met with the social studies teachers,
and we created units

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.958
that would hit curriculum outcomes,
but would also address the racism

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.226
that was happening.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.428
We talked about Black History Month.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.031
We talked
about what it means to be an ally,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.102
and we talked about microaggressions
and what they are and why they hurt.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.172
And so we really focused on that.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:58.077
And then in my role as a, language
support teacher, I also included scaffolds

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.581
and those lessons
for our language learners.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.217
If I'm to offer

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:08.121
teachers any advice
it would be coming from my own experience.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:13.493
So I know that as a teacher and coming
from a place of privilege, it is sometimes

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:18.097
difficult for me to recognize
discrimination when it happens.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.100
Or rather,
to recognize the severity of it.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.304
A lot of times, discriminatory language

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.274
can be disguised as a joke
and even intended as a joke.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.712
But that does not mean that it's not
hurting the people on the receiving end.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.249
It is very important that as teachers,

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:40.954
we recognize our power
and our relationship of trust

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.023
with these students
and cultivate that trust

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.460
so they can tell us
when they're experiencing this.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.931
I also think it's very important
to continue teacher education

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:57.036
on these topics, because as teachers,
when we know better, we will do better.
