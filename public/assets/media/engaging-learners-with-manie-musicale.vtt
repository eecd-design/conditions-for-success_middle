00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.042
I'm Emma Hemphill.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:13.213
I teach grade 16 French immersion
and pass at Fundy Middle and High School.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.383
Part of our French immersion programing,
we have done

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:20.820
many Scad
which is a bracket of French artists

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.957
selected by a group of teachers
from the US.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:28.128
They put together a fabulous program,
a French artist from around the world.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.564
And it gives kids an opportunity
to broaden their horizons

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.432
with French culture.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:37.137
So, how it works is we have each song
cycle against each other, and the students

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.206
get to vote for their favorite
and fill out their brackets.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.775
And we also vote as a class,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.979
and we get to vote with every other kid
in the world who does it.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:50.083
There was over 100,000 kids,
I think, that participated globally,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.788
and it's fun because they're adding songs
onto their playlists that they like.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.524
They get to learn
about different countries,

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.126
French countries,
and we do it with the Pip classes as well.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:05.298
And they also get, really involved
and into it, which is nice to see because,

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:09.169
the French immersion kids
have a more link to the French culture

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:13.306
aspect, but, it really brings
the kids that are taking post

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.576
intensive French into that part of French,

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.579
because they don't necessarily
get a lot of exposure to the culture part.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.183
So the people that design the whole thing
spend quite a bit of time

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:26.653
on it, actually, and there's a whole drive
of activities and,

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:30.623
we analyze lyrics, we talk about,

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.094
like those part, that part,
but the part that the kids get really

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.595
excited about is the voting system.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.598
And so it would be like a march madness
basketball bracket.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:39.566
Less complicated.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.033
Obviously.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.337
But, they put songs up against each other
and there's two different sides

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.371
of the bracket.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.974
And, eventually it comes out with two,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.444
distinct opponents,
and the kids have to vote.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:55.181
And then when they, they release, videos
that,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:02:00.053
tell the kids who won each, each round
and, the kids get very into that as well.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.656
They ask every day all the time for
have they release anyone?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.092
Do we know who won between these two?

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:10.363
And sometimes the class is very divided,
so they're very competitive.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:15.902
So one thing I've noticed
is that when we like,

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:20.039
we've done lyric analysis
or talk about themes within music,

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.941
with many music out in my classroom,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.177
and the kids really like it
because they're already familiar

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.914
with the songs or the artists
from previous years, or from listening

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.284
to more songs
from artists from previous, many years.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.654
And so they're very invested that way.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.657
It's nice to see them
care about something like.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.759
They really, really like it.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.830
And, with post intensive French,
they don't necessarily do the lyric

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.135
analysis that we do in Selah, but,
we do do some lyric stuff with them.

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:53.473
And they also like making the connection
between the French words

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.942
and then understanding more about what
the song is about.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.877
In English, we watch music videos.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:01.381
We, listen to the song multiple times,

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.517
and many musical has a playlist
for every year on YouTube.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.719
And so the kids will often ask,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.856
can we listen to last year
many playlists while we work?

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:15.695
So it's been a positive
French, experience for them.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.132
And it's nice because they also get
to see different aspects of French

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.135
culture in Africa and Europe
and other places around the world.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:27.807
My name is has, a website that you go to
and teachers can register their school.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.010
So typically I think it's one teacher
that registers the whole schools.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.880
And we have access to all the things
that they have created.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.850
Plus, when teachers create stuff,
they can send them in and they upload them

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.322
into, things a Google Drive or a Padlet
or something or both that they've used.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.990
So they

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.193
use that and we get access
to all of those things.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.963
They'll release all the songs
that are available at once,

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.365
so we can go through them,
because then when the voting starts,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.499
you have to have done

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.704
your bracket already, and it takes quite
a bit of time to get through 16 songs.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.073
So we usually start about a month before.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.611
So, the kids vote, they vote as a class
and they fill out their own brackets

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.179
because we do a little competition of like

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.314
who can get the most points
like individually as well.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.684
So it encourages them
not to just vote with everyone else.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.255
And yeah, that's basically it.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.289
And then it depends on

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.291
like we try and link
what we're doing and feel

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.193
to some of the activities that they give.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.930
And because really like,
but when they do the reveal videos,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.167
they put videos that teachers
have submitted of the kids doing dances

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:32.605
to the songs or art that they've created
and means that they've created.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.042
And so the kids get to see
all of the other students globally

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.178
participating in many, too,
because they'll say, oh,

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:43.816
from Ottawa, Ontario,
and it'll be the kids dancing or the art

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:47.787
or what have you, but implementing it,
I would just say go for it.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.290
You can't do it wrong.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.924
So it's not something
that you have to follow.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.726
It's not a prescribed thing.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.663
You can make it work for you
in your classroom, but it really does

00:04:56.663 --> 00:05:00.867
bring a lot of, fun and entertainment
and a good way

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:04.771
to connect with the kids through music,
because that's also part of the secret.
