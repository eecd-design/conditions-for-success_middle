Hello, my name is Matthew Legere.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.411
I am a language arts

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.115
teacher at River Valley Middle School
and I teach grade eight and grade seven.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.052
I'm here today to talk about
universal design for learning

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:24.924
and how we can, make the curriculum
fit all students.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.695
Sometimes the problem of curriculum
is that the students are made to fit

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.866
the curriculum, where we really need
to tailor learning experiences

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.869
for all the different types of students
that we have.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.506
One thing that I like to do
when I teach kids

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.542
is have them realize
about their growth mindset

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:48.748
so they can realize their potential,
and that failure is, something

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:52.852
that they can embrace as an opportunity
to learn from their mistakes.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.689
I believe teacher student connections
are important to support learning.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:01.661
Another another important thing in UDL
is developing community.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:06.499
Giving the kids
boundaries and expectations to help them

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.601
move towards success.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:14.374
To make UDL really work in my class,
I like to use a flexible framework.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.844
It's similar to the daily
five in elementary school.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:23.016
My kids know it as the cafe,
and some days I give them a cafe menu

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.219
and they can choose
how they want to represent their learning

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.689
or whether they want to write,
whether they want to read.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.692
And then they can take ownership
of their learning.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.563
Differentiation
has the ability for students

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.832
to find their work more appealing.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:42.168
It helps students represent
learning to their strengths

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.804
and also in a differentiated environment.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.141
Students can set goals, monitor
their own learning.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.011
And again, I would say giving choice
to these students,

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.715
also creates an opportunity
for enrichment and critical thinking.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:00.420
If I was encouraging other teachers
to use universal

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.058
design for learning and,
differentiating their instruction,

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:09.095
it does take a little bit of patience
and organization.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.398
And most of all, you really need to train

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.401
the students to buy in what you're doing.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.972
And to have that growth mindset.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.641
You know, you think about grade eight.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.244
I kind of give them the mindset.
You're not really in any grade.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.313
You're you are you and you're doing what

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.450
you're doing to your best of your ability.
