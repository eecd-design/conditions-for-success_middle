00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
Welcome to the Middle Level
Developmental Success Continuum Support

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.649
Website, your guide to using this New
Brunswick-developed tool with

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.170
confidence and clarity. The continuums
were designed to help middle schools

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.129
see where they are, celebrate what's
working, and take purposeful steps

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:23.510
towards practices that meet the needs
of young adolescents. This tool also

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.790
supports schools in knowing whether
they are truly demonstrating middle

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.950
school practices and in understanding
what those practices look, sound, and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.990
feel like in action. If you teach, lead,
or support in the middle years, you

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.799
know this work is shaped by a deep
understanding of students aged 11 to 14.

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:50.549
In grades 6 to 8, learners are finding
their way and shaping their identities,

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.150
learning how to stand out while still
fitting in. They have strong opinions

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.970
and growing confidence, and they're
learning to critique what they see,

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:06.149
reason with evidence, and communicate
in many ways. Their peers, media and

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.668
social media are powerful influences,
and they're balancing a new set

00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:15.469
of responsibilities. Some chosen,
others expected. Middle Level

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.749
Philosophy is about creating a balanced,
supportive environment that fosters

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.509
academic growth, social-emotional
development, and a sense of belonging.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.268
It connects learning to students'
interests, experiences, and the events

00:01:29.268 --> 00:01:34.839
shaping their lives. Middle schools are
catalysts for change, shaping the

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:40.400
trajectory of young adolescents for
years to come. When challenged with

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.389
complex ideas connected to real world
applications and given the tools to

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.919
explore their future selves, they grow
into the people they are meant to

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:55.160
become. The Conditions for Success
Developmental Continuums were created

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.199
with 8 early adopter schools and guided
by an advisory team of Principals, Vice

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:05.760
Principals, District Leaders, and
Teachers. They are grounded in the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.279
voices of learners and educators who
know middle school best and informed by

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:17.639
research into what works. The framework
is built around 7 key indicators we

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:23.839
call "The Big 7." Leadership and Teaming,
Access and Equity, Relationships,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.580
Empathy, Identities, High-yield
Instructional Practices, and Meaningful

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.169
Learning Experiences. These are the
building blocks of responsive,

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.139
inclusive, and empowering middle
schools. The continuums are more than a

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:44.610
checklist. They are a clear visual
roadmap. This tool helps you self-assess, 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.690
set priorities, and spark rich
conversations with your team. It aligns

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.850
with the Holistic Curriculum Framework
and Tiered Interventions, and supports

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.649
students' academic, social-emotional,
and behavioural needs through strong

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.649
instruction, curriculum mastery,
professional learning, and

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:08.369
collaborative problem solving. The new
interactive best practices website

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:13.360
brings this assessment tool to life.
Explore it today to see examples from

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.830

Middle Level Developmental Success

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.520
Continuums really represents our shared
commitment to doing what's best for

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.100
young adolescents. Use them with your
team, explore, reflect, and plan

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.179
purposeful next steps. Together we can
create the conditions that empower

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:39.479
middle level educators, families,
support staff, and learners to grow,

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.559
belong, and achieve.
