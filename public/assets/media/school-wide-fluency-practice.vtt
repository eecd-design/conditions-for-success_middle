WEBVTT

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:08.975
Hi, my name

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.978
is Lori and I'm a teacher at River Valley
Middle School.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.648
I'm going to talk to you today
about an initiative that this school took

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.017
on the entire school.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.818
Does this three days a week.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.255
And it's just a two paragraph
fluency passage

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.725
where kids are focusing on their rhythm
and phrasing.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.594
And punctuation.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.262
So what happens in our mornings

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.265
on Monday, Wednesday, Friday
after announcements are made?

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.268
Someone down in the office
will announce for kids to,

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.972
get their sheet of paper,
and do their fluency passage.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.141
So they get the paper,
they find a partner,

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.144
they work with the same person
over the course of the week.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.879
There's two paragraphs.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.647
One partner reads one paragraph.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.682
The other one reads the other paragraph.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.451
The same one all three days.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.788
And we're really focusing on the rhythm
and phrasing here,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.791
which is reading punctuation
and vocabulary.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.292
If your friend that you're reading with

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.295
is able to help you with vocabulary,
absolutely do that.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:05.331
If you get stuck on one, we just ask
that you underline or highlight.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.969
Because at the end of the week,
they get collected and then, bank of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.074
unfamiliar words is made and then sent out
to, the subject teacher,

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.410
because a great thing with these, again,
they can be cross-curricular.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.245
So, you could one week

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.248
have a science piece,
the next week could be a social studies.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:26.019
And it's not meant to stump
kids, like, with unfamiliar words.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.322
So that's why when I make them,
I always talk with the teacher to find out

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.325
what they've been doing
so the kids will be familiar with it.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.562
I also will throw maybe a piece
of figurative language in there,

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.864
just to add a little bit of spice to it,

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.867
but we'll maybe she'll have Grace
and Olivia here.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.370
And we'll show you kind of what it looks
like, on the run of the morning.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.508
July 1st is an important day in Canada

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.712
because it is a Canada Day,
the country's national holiday.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.984
On this day in 1867, Canada
officially became a country

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:02.522
through the signing
of the cannon generation,

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.025
which united the provinces of Ontario,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.062
Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:13.133
The importance of July 1st goes
beyond just celebrating Canada's birthday.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.836
It is also the day to show pride
in being Canadian

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.140
and to reflect
on what makes Canada unique.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:23.710
People wear
red and white wave Canada flags

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.080
and participate in fun community events.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.250
So you just heard Grace and Olivia
reading that passage,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.620
which again is done in the morning,
three days a week when they're done.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.756
It takes about 3 to 5 minutes,
but when they're finished,

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.326
the kids all put the passages
back in a basket in the classroom,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.729
and then it sits there until the next day.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.364
At the end of the week.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.268
Here at the school, I collected them all
and then went through every passage

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.202
in the school.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.271
And any words that were underlined
or highlighted.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.308
I made a bank, and then I emailed them out
so that they could see any issues

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:59.746
with vocabulary or meaning, and then they
can incorporate it into their lessons.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.650
And again, the big focus here
was the rhythm and phrasing,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.556
and vocabulary and also providing
feedback, you know, to your partner and,

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.925
you know,
I witnessed a few times this year,

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:16.095
when I overheard students saying
to their classmate like, wow, you did

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:20.333
really good that time reading that,
which is exactly what we want to see.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.570
Today I'm going to talk to you
about something that we call,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.205
fluency screeners.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.075
That is a tool that you have access
to on teams

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:32.512
as teachers,
that you can look at students reading.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.415
It's very easy to create.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.483
Just couple of steps to follow.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:42.488
And it's fantastic because it allows you
to individualize the reading passages.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.558
So if you want students
that are individualized

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:49.629
to have it adjusted, and even kids
that really excel at reading,

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.732
you can put them at different levels.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.168
Also,
they can be created cross-curricular.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.371
So you can bring in different
subject areas into it.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:03.343
When creating them, you can,
either pull from a library bank on teams.

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:09.215
There's also an AI option, and there is
also the option to upload, on your own.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:14.287
So I've got a couple students here with me
today that I'm going to get them, Grace

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.824
and Olivia to show you what it looks like
from a student's perspective.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.628
When they log into teams
and then go into, in this case,

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:25.598
their language arts team,
to see what the screener looks like,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.467
the importance of the hydrosphere.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.470
The hydrosphere is one of the most
important systems on Earth.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.340
It includes all water on our planet,
such as oceans,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.811
lakes, rivers, glaciers,
and even water found underground.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.415
Water is essential for life
without the hydrosphere.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.853
Living things like plants, animals,
and humans would not be able to survive.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.757
So Hydro Sphere helps to support life
by providing drinking

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:54.460
water, growing food,
and keeping the environment balanced.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.631
So you just heard Olivia reading,
the fluency screener that is on teams.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:03.036
So now that she's completed it, now
the data gets sent back to the teacher.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:06.406
So we're just going to take a look on my
laptop,

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.243
to see how she did, on that assignment.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.613
So you can see here
that it's that it's turned in.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.582
Grace has looked at hers,
but is not completed yet.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.419
So here's the data
that the teacher gets to see.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.323
Not only can they watch and listen
to, Olivia reading.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.126
It also gives you,
how many words per minute she read,

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.695
which is 131, which is good.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.263
So great job, Olivia.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.400
It also gives you some other data
accuracy rates and mispronunciations.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.637
And you'll notice different
things are highlighted

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.506
on here
that tells you words that were left out.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.108
If they were repeated.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.978
You can also go into the comprehension
because she did do some comprehension

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:49.649
questions on it, which the student
gets instant feedback on.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.152
But as the teacher,
if you want to see her like, awesome.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.821
There were three questions.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.923
And she got all of them right.

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.158
If you go into the expression.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.362
Okay, you can go through
and it kind of color codes,

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.932
different things and you can click on it
saying what happened here?

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.168
It's saying that she, rushed her
reading,

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:12.271
this little different colored
that a period was skipped.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:17.543
So the data that a teacher can get
from this particular, fluency screener

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.880
can help guide the teacher's instruction
in the classroom.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.517
Whether it's something like
rhythm and phrasing, focusing on making

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:28.154
sure that students are reading punctuation
properly in the passage.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:31.991
If kids are struggling on a
for on the same word within a passage,

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:35.194
and you can do some word work on that,
or it may identify

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:38.398
students
that need extra support in their reading.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.301
So it is a really good tool,
and it's something that our school here

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:46.439
at Reveille took on this year, that
the kids completed one every two weeks

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.076
and it got uploaded, to their teachers
that they could use that

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.644
and it can be done.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.647
His homework doesn't
have to be done at school, which is great.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:58.484
But we did offer options for kids
if they didn't have access at home,

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.921
opportunities throughout the week
that they could get it done

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:05.825
so that it was was done
and that the teachers had the data to use.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:09.128
And it shows growth over time
because it records all of the readings,

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:12.298
and it can show their progress
on how they're doing.
