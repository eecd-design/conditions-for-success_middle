00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.943
Hi, my name is Cindy Fraser.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.245
I teach French immersion language arts.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.282
Social studies, pemf
and personal wellness in grade

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.084
eight here at George Street Middle School.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:23.823
So today I'm going to discuss,
my cross-curricular approach to,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:24.591
the feel,

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.628
curriculum, French immersion language arts
curriculum and personal wellness.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:32.399
And how I've combined the two,
to address

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.668
all the outcomes in the limited time
that we're given.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:39.305
Essentially, we were tasked with teaching

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.043
two curriculums in the time for one.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:48.982
So, I started last year by
looking at the personal wellness outcomes

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:52.452
and how I might be able to address them
in their second language.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.455
Kind of get a two for one situation.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:01:00.126
And, so I started last year
just making sure that our themes

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.528
in feel out

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:06.232
for speaking, listening, reading, writing,
just related to personal wellness.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:11.438
And then conveniently, we got,
the grade eight curriculum document

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:15.542
for that was new
that just got rolled out, last year.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.945
And just by fluke, they, they match.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.213
They fit quite well.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:23.183
So we function by inquiry based questions.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.884
They're called these on cat.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:31.624
And the first one and the last one,
incorporate personal wellness ideas.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.994
So it kind of like it worked itself out.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.930
What I had done
last year made perfect sense.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.532
And then I was able to build off of that.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:43.603
So essentially, I'm just making sure I'm
hitting all of my personal wellness

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.405
outcomes in French.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:50.009
So they're improving their language
skills, in all aspects,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.377
in all three strands.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.415
But we're doing it
with the personal wellness lens.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:01.054
I should specify not for all the strands,
for the personal wellness

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.090
strands connected to mental fitness,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.160
relationships and wellness

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.763
in terms of their French language,
they've built,

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:16.836
a lot of vocabulary, thematic vocabulary
related to the subject matter.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.672
We've had to

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:23.042
learn how to talk about how we feel
and what we think

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.146
and our perceptions of the world and, how

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.482
to act in relationships and interactions
and those sorts of things.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:34.487
So they've built the vocabulary
they've built is probably different

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.690
than they would have in the past,
because that's what we're focusing on.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.760
So that fluency

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.931
has gotten better over time,
especially where

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.934
I started the year with it,
and then I'm ending the year with it.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:52.505
I've also noticed middle schoolers
like to talk about themselves,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.943
so the topic is very tangible for them.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.611
They understand the importance of it

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:02.448
and the relevance, and it matters to them,
like relationships and ideas and,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:06.886
things that they can actually do
and act on and that they already know.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.689
They know how to be healthy
to some extent.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.927
They don't necessarily know how to deal
with bad situations.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:17.430
So that's been nice to see, them grow.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.535
And in the past with health often
or personal wellness, it's taught in

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.306
like little like ten week increments
and then they move on.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:30.944
And I'm not sure they go deep into it, not
through the fault of anyone, just time.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.112
But they're stuck with me all year.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.115
So throughout the whole year,
even when we weren't doing

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.852
personal wellness, I could draw
on those skills that they learned.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:44.424
So it it was kind of cross-curricular
all year long.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.993
So it was it was just easier, I think.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:52.665
And I think overall their learning of
the personal on this curriculum is deeper

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:57.570
because it's kind of an all year thing
as opposed to ten weeks and you're done.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.741
One of the big kind of challenges
or conveniences

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.744
for me
is the fact that I am teaching them.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:09.716
Actually, the group's three subjects,
because I also teach them social studies.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:14.254
And in fact, I do cross-curricular
a social studies component,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:18.625
the career Planning and Personal wellness
I also address through social studies.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:23.663
So it is a scheduling convenience for me
so that for someone

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.633
who hasn't really thought of that before,
it is an issue.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:31.371
You have to see those students, in both

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.374
subjects for, I think for it to work
the way it has for me.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:39.145
I also think it can be done in language
arts, not just French immersion.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.180
I just happen to teach French immersion,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.084
but I think language arts
teachers could leverage that time as well.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.053
So it doesn't have to be just the CLA.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:48.788
But I

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.358
do think there is a benefit
in having them.

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.495
You have to be responsible
for both curriculums.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:05:00.933
I think for it to to be able to dig in
the way that we've been able to this year.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:06.139
The other thing is to recognize
that you're not going to touch all you're

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.142
not going to get all those outcomes
done in personal wellness.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.712
You kind of have to let the kids guide
you a little bit.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:16.949
So there's some things I touched on
just because this group this year

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.053
didn't seem to need so much on.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:24.023
I'm trying to think on,

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:27.193
discrimination
and anti-discrimination that we did.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.196
We talked about it,
but I didn't dig into that so much.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.833
Because we're seeing a lot of issues
a social media and all of that.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.736
So I kind of focused on that
with this group.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.171
But maybe next year it'll be different.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.874
So you kind of have to let them guide you
a little bit and see what they need.

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:46.612
That's the nice part of personal wellness
you can sort of see as a group dynamic,

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:51.617
what may be lacking in those kids
and kind of steer in that direction.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.986
I think my reflection is

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:55.555
twofold.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.292
The first is, I'm glad
that I had kind of started that before

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.862
the curriculum came out,
and it just by fluke, worked out,

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.399
and I'm thankful for it

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.903
because it has allowed me to continue
the way I thought it should go anyway.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.605
So that was helpful.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:15.108
I would say I will likely.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:15.742
I'm hopeful

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:20.046
that my schedule allows it every year
because I've seen the the benefits.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.781
I still have a lot to do.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:26.419
I'm going to be redoing it
every year, changing things, and so on.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.421
But I've really

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.391
at first
we were overwhelmed as fellow teachers.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:36.696
Oh gosh, you want me to teach French
and social studies and personal wellness,

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:41.334
but you're only giving me two periods,
two subjects worth of time.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.136
And it was overwhelming.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.771
But when you just step back and you.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:47.039
You see that,
you know, you can use language

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.875
as the vehicle to learn the topics.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.643
It's really not so bad.

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:54.547
And I've actually enjoyed it really,

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:57.917
because it's you get to know the kids more
because you're talking about them.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:02.021
So there's a whole lot of
benefits, I think, to that.
