WEBVTT

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.043
my name is Charlie Harvey and

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:14.014
I work here at Port Elgin School
as a cultural support worker.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.815
Indigenous cultural support worker.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.985
My given name, my spirit name
that was given to me through a naming

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:23.456
ceremony is actually Derek Cebu Psalm one,
which means gentle river waters.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.560
And I'm here today
to talk about indigenous education

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.197
and how it, is reflected
in the students identities in our school.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:35.502
Okay, well, indigenous, culture is,

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.505
represented in this school
in different ways.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.641
When you come in the building,
we have bulletin boards, and sometimes we

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.379
have mock teepees, or I'll put up displays
for certain, events that are happening

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.151
within the indigenous culture, like,
September 30th as every child matters.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.287
We just had MMW yesterday or no Monday.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.159
And, in other ways, we,
we do things within the school.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.361
So I might go into classrooms

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.397
and do some medicine will teachings
or other teachings about the culture.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.535
I'll take students one on one
or in small groups and then we learn

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.238
anything from language
to medicine, more teachings.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.208
We have, the seven sacred teachings.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.044
We do one every month

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.047
so that the entire school learns
about our teachings.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.551
We do drum circles at lunchtime.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:28.655
We also perform in the assemblies
and the concerts that they have.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:34.594
We have we actually have, minimal
learning space outside that we can go to.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.731
And there's a structure out there where
we're hoping to get a TV on, on premise,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.901
to use as an outdoor classroom.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.939
And we can go out and we can do smudging
and we can do different, outdoor

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:46.406
teachings.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.742
Outdoor learning is really, really big
within the indigenous community

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:50.243
and culture.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:54.614
So, there's a PBL going on right now.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.017
That's,
that's focusing on indigenous culture,

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.220
talking about wampum belts
or learning about wampum

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.723
belts, the creation story
and other things like that.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.961
So we're kind of like implementing a lot
of different teachings within the PBL.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.664
And I take those
those students out to smudge as well.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.468
So, I work alongside the teachers,
the faculty, the staff,

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.302
anything they need.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.772
If if anybody wants question answers,
I can go into the classroom and help

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.477
teach about the culture that way
just to, you know, maybe take away

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.481
some misgivings that the students
might think about our culture.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.951
So, yeah, there's a lot of different

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.421
facets that that we can
include culture in the school.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.957
And this school is really inclusive
when it comes to that.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.728
So, hello, my name is Bentley.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.532
I’m in grade seven,
I go to Port Elgin school.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.603
So I'm always talk about, smudging

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.940
and what it schemes for
and why people use it.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.942
So why do people.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.945
Why do we use it?

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.748
We use shade.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.950
It's a different type of smudging.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.419
It'll take all the negative away.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.791
So trap all the negativity into the smoke
and it will go up to the creator.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.427
And that will take care of it.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.929
They go through your body.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.932
It keeps your life calm.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.701
Peaceful class is I love it.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.069
It's magical.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.273
And, it's used to add
all the positivity to you.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.243
And it will be good for you.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:33.112
And you can smudge your health as well.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:37.250
What will take all the negativity away
and add on the positivity of you?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.253
Speak. Glass. Yeah, yeah.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.589
with the, with the two sides of the coin
having like

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.592
your indigenous students
and your non-Indigenous students,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:50.029
and the indigenous students
that I work with, I share a language.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.266
I share different, ceremonies with them.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.101
I share like some are,

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.804
some are more sacred
that that are to be shared

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.272
like within the indigenous community,

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.975
not necessarily
with the non-Indigenous community.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.344
So there's what I'm with.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.546
My little groups of students
are one on one.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:11.184
It can either be for like those kind
of teachings, like the deeper teachings.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:15.822
Or it could be just a safe space
for them to come because they know that,

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.025
you know, culturally,
they're they're safe.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.060
And, you know, in
the, in the cultural space.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.730
But it also means like,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.133
you know, how do I do make my way
through the week with the school?

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.737
So everybody in the school
is getting to learn the new language,

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.106
and it's giving connection
for the indigenous students

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.874
to actually talk to other students. Right.

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:38.111
And they're learning the words and
whatnot, and they're sharing the words.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.748
And, so it gives the kids a sense of,

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.485
validation, even,
you know, within their culture.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.822
And I think that, you know,
when they come in

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:53.293
and they say, Charlie, that being the word
of the day is, you know, up to,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.428
you know, and that means welcome. There.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.362
They're full of pride

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:59.832
when they're doing it, and they're smiling
because that's their culture.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.734
That's them. That's who they are.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.970
So when we're learning
about the medicine world teachings

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.307
and we're learning about all of these,
the other teachings that we do,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.275
and they go out
and they share it with their friends.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.178
Their friends
already have an idea in some aspects.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:15.114
So it gives them more connection
within the school.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.650
So I think that's a really important

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.788
part of, you know, allowing children
to know their identity. And

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.957
know it and share it,

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.527
you know, and, I think

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:30.296
as a, as a cultural support worker,

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.299
I can be I can be a helpful stepping stone
in that process.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.003
And helping the kids to connect

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.173
with their culture and with everybody else
in the school as well.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.942
So how this got started for me?

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:46.612
I was at a powwow and there were,
there was a support,

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:50.883
cultural support worker, actually,
Kevin, who's here today, he actually goes

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:56.122
to different schools and, teaches
what he, what his strengths are.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:06:00.560
So he might or he might work on drums
or rattles or we're working on paddles,

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.495
in this segment.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.965
And so he'll come and he'll work with
the students on some different projects.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:12.004
But, I met him at a powwow, and,
he gave me a pamphlet on,

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:16.042
cultural support work, and I applied,
and this is how I started

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:21.647
the whole the whole process of,
coming into Jordan's principal, you know,

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.552
policies have made it possible
for Jordan's principal

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:30.923
to come in and support our work
in bringing culture to the students.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:34.494
And connecting, connecting the students
with their identity.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.497
And,
because college culture is a really big,

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:40.500
identification aspect for students.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:44.804
And, we just had a cultural showcase
here last week,

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:48.474
and we had the drummers come in and all
the dancers with the different regalia,

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.211
and I made the ribbon skirts
and shirts for my students,

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:56.482
and they were able to go in there and they
they were so

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.752
like they were just so full of pride,
you know,

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.455
they got to the beat
at the ceremonial drum.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.691
The guys did, and the girls got to dance
and they learned all the different dances.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.862
And it was just it was so heartwarming
to see them, to watch them

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:13.566
within their own culture and connecting
to those, those aspects right.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.936
So Jordan's principal

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.206
anglophones has made that possible,
you know,

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.743
through, through through the policies
and bringing in cultural support workers.
