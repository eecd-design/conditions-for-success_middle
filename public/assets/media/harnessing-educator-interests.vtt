00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.143
My name is Duncan Dixon.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.146
I'm the technology teacher
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.983
What I'm here to talk about today
is that is how I bring my personal

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.086
passions, into my workplace
and into my classroom and

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:25.058
and in front of my students and,
I have some odd passions that I would say

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.028
that they're outside of the norm,
but I really like disc golf.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.630
And I do do that
with an engaged group of students.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.265
I've taught disc golf several times.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.933
And air cooled Volkswagens.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:38.905
I've been obsessed with them for 40
years, and, I can't get enough of it, so.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.509
And that's the particular example that,
I want to talk to you about today.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.446
It's just I had a student in my class
that that doesn't read.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.849
And I don't teach. I don't teach English.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.652
I'm just teaching technology,
but he's in my homeroom class

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.389
and in my advisory class, and,
we had done a literacy,

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.760
block and advisory,
and I just noticed that he never read.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.395
He fake read really well.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:06.266
But he had no no interest, no ability,

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.270
no passion for reading, and just didn't
really see anything for him.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.739
But he's a hands on.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.973
Guys have my tech class.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.276
He likes to build stuff
he likes, takes off apart.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.878
So I thought, hey, what about Volkswagens?

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.747
I love Volkswagens that I can show.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.515
You know, share my passion with him.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.351
So I brought in a book, written
by Prescott Phillips,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.354
and suggested
how to rebuild an air cooled motor.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.124
And it's really easy to rebuild
an air cooled motor.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.759
You don't have to be a mechanic.
You don't do anything.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.394
You just have to follow the steps.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.097
So I bought him in this book
and introduced it to him

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:41.067
and said, hey, maybe you could read this,
you know, or just start looking at this

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.236
at least has lots of pictures in it,
you know?

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.105
But it does
have a lot of technical language

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.107
that he would have to figure out
and look up and things like that.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.876
So a great introduction into reading.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.711
If you're not passionate about reading.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.647
We got permission from a XLA teacher
that that could be his book

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.683
for the major project
that they were doing this year,

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.053
which was lit on,
basically a science fair for books.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.556
And he was really nervous about it
because he had never read a book,

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.993
you know, had and didn't really have
any plans on reading one at this point.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.095
But he really enjoyed this book.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.765
So we started just by him, you know,
scanning through it, looking through it,

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.869
looking at the pictures, seeing what,
you know, what was it was all about.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.705
And then creating things
like the list of tools,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.473
because there's a whole
first chapter is just

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.876
these are the tools
you need, in order to do this.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:27.180
So he created his own personal list,
and I told him if he got into it enough

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.249
that maybe I could bring in a motor
next year and,

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.317
you know, for an engage project
or something, a bunch of us

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.553
could try to rebuild this motor.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.156
And he that excited him
a little bit more even, you know,

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.690
but I said he'd have to read the book
first.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.026
You know, it's no good to me
if he hasn't read the book.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.295
So, And then he started reading the book.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.498
And I
would bring in other Volkswagen books

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.601
because of course, being a Volkswagen
fanatic, I have 50 Volkswagen books.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.639
I would just bring them in when we were
doing a reading block and advisory,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.942
and I'd read that one
and he'd come over and see that book

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.045
and realize, hey, there's
more than one of these type of books.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.280
And he'd, you know, flip through

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.115
and he find little bits and read it and,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.284
you know,
showed a lot of interest in them.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.053
So he's you know, he's looking at it
saying, hey, there's lots of books

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.521
in this series of books.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.858
And just all the normal things
that the kids who love to read.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.893
They pick books based on.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.396
Are there six of them in this series?
Like, you know, I love this one.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.363
Is there more?

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.668
And he's seeing that, you know, again,
I don't care if he likes Volkswagens.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.037
You know,
he could be a Chevy guy or anything,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:28.541
but maybe we have to start looking
as teachers and educators that

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.045
not everybody's going to read Shakespeare,
but everybody can read and can.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:36.349
And it's just as valuable
to read a technical manual or a

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.352
how to book than it is any other book.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:39.652
Right?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.720
readings, reading,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.487
you know, like,

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.890
I mean, there's a lot of educators
who can't change the oil

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.160
their own car, you know,
but they're somehow up here, you know?

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.662
So but the kid who knows, it's amazing.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:53.800
You know,
and so he did a the Lincoln Project, and,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.803
I mean, now, this isn't
the best of the Litecoin projects,

00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.340
but for this particular student,
this is unreal.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.708
Like, this is unheard of.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.209
He would never have done this.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.878
And, you know, I mean, he
he may not be an artist.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.380
I'm going to drop my mic here.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.249
May not be an artist
and and all those things.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.316
And he's got a ways to go.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:15.188
But but he's got all the information
he needed to he, he read the book.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:18.224
He watched podcast of the author
talking about the book.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.461
He had lots of other, other things

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.931
that stemmed from it, which, again,
readers, do you want more information?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.867
You want to know more about this person
and the party struggling with the most,

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.870
really, was the bio of the author,
because the author is not an author.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:34.207
He's a mechanic who was tired of
not having a perfect book.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.308
So he wrote it.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:38.511
And, but he did it and he presented it.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.714
And I don't know, just when I see that

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:46.386
it was such a big win
over the super literate kid who,

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.323
you know, has read 50 books by now
and can just present something beautiful.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.592
I think that's wonderful. That's amazing.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.895
This is more impressive to me,
you know, that this kid who's never read

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.499
managed to read a book and do this,
and now he's, you know, we're because I'm

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.167
looking for a motor right now.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:04.037
I'm trying to
so we can come in and build it next year.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.371
And it'll be fun. So.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.206
And he'll be a good asset because.

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.976
And there's actually another kid
who's now reading the book based on this.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.878
Good thing
you got to read this, you know, so

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.648
being able to you can recommend a book
to somebody that the feels good.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.416
You know.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:21.020
So anyway I that it's one small example
about how personal passions

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.791
can can really work into
you know, what we do every day.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.060
I mean, in the woodshop,
I do the same in the cooking.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.028
We do the same. I'm passionate
about all those things.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:32.065
But when you get something
that you're really passionate about,

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.067
you can always find a way to bring it
in, you know?

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.669
So it's it's been really fun project.
