00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.676
My name is Heather Dickson.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.845
I'm the principal at Marshview
Middle School.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.549
And today I wanted to talk about how we
looked at schoolwide literacy practices.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.418
I have two examples today.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.920
One was with our science fair

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.757
when we had our science fair
set up in the gymnasium,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.227
the Ela teachers went around
to the different booths

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.795
and the different projects

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.765
to talk to the kids and assess
their speaking and listening outcomes.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:37.737
It was amazing to hear some of the stories
from the Ela teachers as they went

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:42.976
to students who had a deep passion
and enthusiasm,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:46.346
enthusiasm for science.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.847
And one of the teachers reported

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:51.551
that they stopped by a project
and spoke to one of our students

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:57.624
who was so vibrant, he was willing to
just talk about his entire project,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:03.463
and it was something that she didn't
get to see in her Ela classroom.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:04.831
The other

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.601
example I have is our school wide lit
Com event.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:13.673
So students in grade five through eight
were responsible for reading a book.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.676
It was presented science fair style,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.147
but everyone in the building
was responsible for a book report.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.750
Essentially,
they had it out on poster boards.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.618
We invited the community in.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:29.756
But for that one month, everybody in
our building was talking about reading.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.357
We were talking about books.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.159
We were talking about literacy.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.764
And there was definitely
the social pressure there,

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:42.702
for students to be reading a book,
to be talking about books.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.041
We had the students visit each booth
and they filled out a bingo form.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:53.379
They also, created a list of books
that they wanted to read, that

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.382
then we communicated with the parents
and said, they're coming home with a list.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.885
You know, you can foster a love
of reading at home as well.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.821
So tips and tricks that I

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.458
would give
if you are looking at this in your school

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.696
or about,
boosting your school wide literacy,

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.033
it's really looking at that
cross-curricular piece, having the Ela

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.838
teachers be able to look at different
outcomes in the speaking and listening,

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:22.075
in different writing
across the subject areas.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.246
I can't say enough
about the success of Lit Con.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.216
If really created an entire buzz
throughout our school.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:34.254
We dedicated four afternoons
where the students could be working on

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.321
their projects.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:39.859
We had the art room open,
there was a group in the computer lab.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.763
They could work in their classroom,
but really it was four afternoons

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:47.167
that they were dedicated
to, you know, the project completion.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.037
So I was just checking in with the kids
throughout the time to make sure that

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:51.738
they were on track.
