00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.009
Hi, my

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.612
name is Eden and I work at Fundy Middle
and High School as an English teacher.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:17.083
I do a lot of formative assessments with
my students in various different ways.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.187
I do a lot of conversation
with my students.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.557
I do, products and product based things.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.961
I always, have multiple different ways

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.931
that I like to see their progress and see,
where they're at.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.268
And then I take those
and I decide how we're moving forward.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.671
Some of my formative assessment,
include Flipboard cruisers.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:39.839
And I really like those

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.909
because I can have a genuine conversation
with the students and kind of see

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.412
what is their thinking
and where are they at with

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.347
what I've just taught
or what I've just talked about.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.183
And then we can kind of
take the lesson from there as we need to.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.686
So I find that the results are, can vary,

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.424
but I find that it really guides
what I'm going to do with them.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.194
Either in the moment, I
might make a change right in that moment,

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.597
or I might decide to switch up my lesson
for the next day and say, nope,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.566
they need a little more extension
on something.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.569
Or no, they've mastered that,
and I'm able to move on to the next task.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.973
Sometimes you just have to jump in and
just try it and see what works for you.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.509
I think,
every classroom is a little bit different.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.610
All the students
are a little bit different.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.613
So sometimes I do
like the Flipboard cruisers for some kids

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.616
and some students, I
they prefer to do paper and pen.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.387
And so my strategies will change
depending on who the students are.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.523
And what what subject
I'm teaching at the time.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:35.528
So I'd say jump in and try some things,
see what works, and move from there.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.399
If you're going to try
to implement this too in your classroom.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.433
You'd want to have a goal.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.868
So the first thing I would suggest

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:44.504
is just to have a goal
of what you're looking for.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.306
Is it going to be that conversation piece?

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.941
Are you looking for a product

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.510
and that's going to determine
where are you going to start?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.515
So if I'm looking for that conversation
and that verbalization of material,

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.251
I'm going to go with conversation and I'm
going to go with the clipboard cruiser.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.122
If I'm taking examples,
as they're happening

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.391
as it flows in class,
I just do a little bit of, a mark.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.128
So sometimes I'll have different keywords.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.598
Sometimes I'll actually put a one, two
or 3 or 4, depending on how they answered.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.600
But if I'm looking for something

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.604
that's more on paper,
you're going to want to start with what

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:22.008
you assessing
and tailor your formative assessment.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.343
That way.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.279
So in action, it's actually,

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.081
I just jump right in with the kids.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.748
Sometimes I like

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.751
to pull small groups aside,
and we'll just have conversations about

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.753
maybe the outcome
that we've been going over

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.889
or a reading strategy
that we're working on.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.492
Today I actually picked a student
and I had them be my demonstrator

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.862
for me and I, as they were,
they didn't know.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.199
But as they were giving me their answers
and helping me out

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.702
kind of teach the strategy, I was putting
marks on my clipboard cruiser.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.206
And so I already knew ahead of time
which strategy I wanted to look at.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.440
And you pick.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.376
It's always nice to pick students
that maybe are a little bit

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.344
stronger at first,
because then they can really help you

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.179
and then you'll say,

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.182
oh, you didn't really, really well,
you got everything you needed to know,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.050
and you were a great example
for the rest of the class.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.053
So then when you go to the rest of the
students, they know what to look for.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.154
They know what you're modeling.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.223
So I let them know ahead of time.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:14.093
But I really like
doing an individual group and whole class.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:19.065
I think the biggest thing I learned
from doing my formative assessments

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.268
is that there's not always one way
that you can get an answer.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:27.974
And so if you are relying on one piece
of data in order to get that students,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:32.745
maybe where they're at at that time
or get a mark for them or comments

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:37.450
to for feedback, you need multiple
different ways in order to show that.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.886
And sometimes conversation is the best.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.590
I have a lot of students
who are, accommodated.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.994
And I really, really find their,
conversation is the best way

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.264
to for them to feel comfortable,
to give me their information.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.367
Sometimes paper and a pen
can be very intimidating

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.702
depending on their skill level.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.503
So I like those conversations best

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.541
in. No matter
what you do for formative assessment,

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:06.546
you need to know that
whatever you do is best for your kids.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.114
You know them the best.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.783
You're their teacher,
and I think that no matter

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.886
what you're doing, what you can do
to make a difference in those kids lives.
