00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.576
My name is Rebecca Rudderham.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.112
I am the principal at Fundy Middle
and High School.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.882
So PLCs professional learning communities
at Fundy Middle and High School.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.686
The we have structured it
in such a way that they are

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:23.256
schedule staff are scheduled to meet twice
every month.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:28.762
And during these scheduled times they
our staff discuss the school improvement

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.298
plan initiatives that they want
to move forward with, or they will discuss

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:37.370
content based,
planning for for our school.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.974
So it entails these structured,

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.911
meeting times in place
as well as they meet all the time.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.382
And the staff rooms, lots of informal
conversations about student learning,

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:53.053
lots of excitement about upcoming plans
and improvement for our school.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.090
I think it's extremely
important that, that

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.592
the, the roll

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:04.297
out of it is, done
in such a way that you, you get staff

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:08.234
Buy-In and they recognize the importance
of working as a team.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.237
And I think that's
what's the most exciting part about,

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.474
the initiative that we're involved in
right now with the middle school pilot

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:19.012
is that with through the math momentum,
our, our teams, have

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.383
gathered together,
they have seen the what what working

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.620
as a group can actually do it
and how it how it, eases

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:32.625
the planning phase, how you can actually,
gauge the achievement of the kids.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.626
You can see the data

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:37.464
that the kids are engaged and they're
excited about learning new concepts.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:43.536
So this particular, initiative
has allowed us to get some more buy in.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.273
And the staff does seem to be really,
really excited about working together

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:50.243
as a team and and recognizing the ease

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.246
how how it can make planning easier.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.948
We've really kind of,

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.083
opted to go in this direction

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.753
because we recognize
that we were meeting as teams.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.124
But we may not have been using it
as effectively as possible.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.793
We weren't necessarily
looking at the data.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.797
We weren't necessarily
like taking our, using our time

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:15.034
to which we came together
with a, specific intent.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:19.205
There was lots of planning
that was being done kind of in silos.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:23.810
But then with this particular,
initiative, we we really committed

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.314
to coming together as a group and with,
with a, with a target, with a goal.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:33.019
And ultimately we're hoping that or at,
we're,

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.856
we want to see this kind of grow,
with all our other,

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.693
PLCs and that other PLCs
can recognize that.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.296
Hey, look what's happening
with the math group.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.098
We could do that in English.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.933
We can do that
in science and social studies

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.504
and eventually lead into hopefully
cross-curricular some more, solid

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.174
cross-curricular
planning it at the middle school level,

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.843
you have to have a champion
that one person to really organize.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.746
I've been blessed that
the team that we are working

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.915
with right now at the middle
school is solid.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:05.151
They all seem to really like each other
and they are committed.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.119
They want to do this.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.190
They and we have one, or 2
or 3 actually people

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.724
who are really kind of driving it forward.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.727
And what ultimately has happened
is that through this,

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:18.798
I'm noticing more and more of our staff
stepping up to take a leadership role

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.899
because it's exciting them.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:24.571
So one person to run the charge
and then slowly people will start

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.675
to, recognize that it's it's
worth it and it's valuable.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.443
And we will see.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:33.046
I suspect we'll see
lots of cool things happening in the fall.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.448
It's been a fantastic experience.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:40.553
I think we've really, really valued,
valued, the time put into,

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.624
the middle school model,

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.961
as we were kind of stuck in a, in a time

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:51.531
where we were doing a lot of,
many high school.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:55.034
So it's been it's been a great experience.
