00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.909
My name is Caitlyn.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.145
I am the behavior intervention mentor
here at Dr.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.580
Losier Middle School.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.583
And we are going to talk
about restorative practices.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:20.720
One of the ways I use
restorative practices in my day to day

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.191
here at the school is when students
will come to me with a conflict,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.661
and we will work through it together

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.664
in a small group in my office.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.566
Another way that I use restorative

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.103
practices in the school is
when a student may come to me

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.307
with conflict with a staff member,
such as a teacher, or in a

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:46.179
and sometimes it's, really beneficial
for them to sit down

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.215
with the adults and see the adult
participate in it with them.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.817
And being willing participant,

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:55.855
and they sit and listen to each other's,
side of the story and what's happening.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.858
And then they come to a,
resolution together.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.961
It's really important
that both parties leave

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.465
feeling
like they have resolved the conflict.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.036
When the two peers come together,
I always make sure that they're

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.139
both willing to participate
in a restorative conversation.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:17.010
They take their turn
talking about the conflict, how

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.948
it made them feel, what's happening,
what they would like to happen at the end.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.053
They always pause and wait
for the other person to say their piece.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.655
There's no talking over each other.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:34.627
There's always turn taking, and at the end
we leave with both parties feeling like

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:38.498
there is some kind of resolution
to the conflict that they're having.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.635
Some tips that I have

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.939
is really making sure that both sides

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:50.043
have their time to talk,
and there's no interrupting.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.681
They really need to say how they feel,
what happened, their side of the story

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.084
before the other person can
then come and say their part.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.655
And it really makes them have empathy
for the other person.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:07.627
Empathy for the other student,
or even when it's adult to student.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.598
We see a lot of the students
kind of having moments

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:15.301
of how the teachers are feeling
or what the teachers are experiencing,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:20.106
and then the teachers or, adult
staff members also are having kind of

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.144
like these big moments of realization
of how the students feel.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.714
So it might have been like
something small, but it grows,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.651
into like a bigger conflict
than it really needed to be.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.686
And this really brings it all to light.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:37.157
Everything's laid out,
and we don't leave until both parties

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.792
feel like they've accomplished
what they need to accomplish.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:44.130
And they're both seeing each other side
and showing each other

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.467
empathy and coming out
feeling like it's been resolved.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.638
One of the things I find in middle
school is when there is conflict

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.306
between students,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.209
it's really common that these students
will go back to their friends

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.946
group, friend groups and talk about it
and never talk about it

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.348
directly with the person
they're having conflict with.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.618
So that is one way that restorative
conversations have been really helpful,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.422
because sometimes there is a conflict
between two students, and it ends up being

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:14.494
a class wide situation, when really it
could have been a one on one conversation

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.164
and it could have gotten fixed
in like one restorative conversation.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:22.068
So that is one reason that I think
that it's a really good tool to use

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:22.835
in a middle school,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.873
specifically because I feel like that,
really coincides with this age group.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:29.776
Yeah.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.511
Now I'm going to need to blooper.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:31.844
Okay.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.847
Yeah. Okay.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.150
Sometimes the students will say

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.622
that it is uncomfortable
or awkward or cringe and I say, yeah.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:46.092
Sometimes these conversations
can be awkward

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.429
and uncomfortable,
but with conflict comes growth.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.132
And with myself,
they're mediating and saying, like,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.802
you tell your side and you tell your side.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:59.739
And I really think that it helps them
become flexible thinkers.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.876
And it also helps them set boundaries
because they can say, no,

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:07.847
I'm not okay with this or no,
I didn't like when you said this.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.116
And it it's really good
for their self-confidence

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.618
to to have those boundaries

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.688
and also be flexible thinkers
and see the other side of a conversation.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:21.427
And it's a skill that we really hope
that they take on to high school

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.163
and then into their adult lives,
because it's a it's really a skill

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.565
that all adults should have as well.
