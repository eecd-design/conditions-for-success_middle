00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.576
My name is Carleigh Bailey.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.378
I work at St. Mary's Academy.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.281
I'm the PhyEd teacher here,
and it's my third year working here.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.718
I was planning to talk about,
the teachers

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.821
that were actually planning
for our Eagle block.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.558
Essentially, we've gotten to meet
a few times outside of school.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.861
And during school hours.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.864
But there's a group of about 4 or 5 of us
that have,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:36.002
collaborated together
to create different,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:41.074
hands on learning experiences
that are in an actual class format.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.810
Not a

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.913
textbook class that we've seen
in the past, not math or science.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.782
It's we've made an outdoor learning.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.683
We've made,

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.420
the Art of sound was one of them.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.488
We have a culinary one.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.125
We have had an entrepreneurship one.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.930
So basically our meeting times
as teachers is to plan

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.768
what that actually looks like
when we are, with the kids and

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.406
it's really
it's really nice because as a teacher,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.876
you don't get time to collaborate
with other teachers.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.180
So as the for Ed teacher, I'm
the Ed teacher.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.981
I don't necessarily get to collaborate

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.284
with others
like every other teacher in here.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:28.021
So it's nice to have designated time
to, plan that out.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.790
And I've been working
with the music teacher,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.293
so that's a complete shift for me.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.830
But I love the opportunity to do that,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.833
and it's definitely,

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.702
it's nice to set goals

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.240
with other teachers and really focus on
what's best for the kids.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.309
The most effective part of our planning

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.312
was when we actually sat down
and talked about,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.181
what does day one one hour look like?

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.283
Okay, we're going to say expectations.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.953
We're going to go over what
this looks like,

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.221
what you're going to be marked on.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:05.291
Because we've actually found a way
to incorporate it with the wellness

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:05.892
curriculum.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.929
So they will receive a mark
for all of these blocks on their report

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.433
card, because that's what we found
was missing from the last block.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.103
As middle schoolers, if they're
doing anything, they want to know why,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.138
they want to know.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.141
Am I going to get a mark for this?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.677
Because if they're not, then effort levels

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.680
differ and focus levels differ as well.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.217
So once we've told them
that they will actually be

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.554
getting a mark for this,
there is a shift in mindset for some.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:39.893
And I think, that was essentially
the start of all of this,

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:44.030
is to create meaningful experiences
for the students, for the staff.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.000
So that was missing from the first part.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.336
But now we've actually created a way
that they will receive a mark for it.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.438
So I know that has helped.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.675
I really wish I had this
when I was in school

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.245
because it's nice for them
to not just be sitting

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.047
and getting lectured at,
getting talked at.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:05.251
We are trying to make it
independent on their part.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.252
So guiding them,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.923
we still we found that we gave
a little bit of freedom at the start,

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:14.294
and then we had to take some steps back
and realize,

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:18.064
okay, middle school,
they they need some guidance.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.265
Now, while it's a new

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.601
it's new for everyone.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:26.306
So we're learning alongside
alongside the kids, which is really nice.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.274
And we've been able to get their feedback.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:31.444
The teachers feedback,
and we're growing it together,

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.813
which I've never been part
of something like that.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:38.251
And so I it's really special
and I'm excited to see it continue,

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.821
because we've only been doing this
for a couple months, and it's already

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.792
looking completely different than what
we initially thought it would look like.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.795
If another school wants to implement
something similar.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.432
I think they need to start with

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:57.837
low expectations,
because we had a lot of big ideas

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:01.074
at the start of ours,
and we had to hone it in

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.577
and make attainable goals.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:10.250
So we started with, wanting it to
our block, and we found that was too long.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.352
So we made it a one hour block.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:16.923
But I think my recommendation
to other schools would be to start,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.562
start small, start basic,
and then you can grow that as you go. But.

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:27.367
That's the advice I would have wanted
to hear from another school starting.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.004
This is remember that you're working
with middle schoolers.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:35.708
It's not going to go as planned
even when it is very planned out.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.111
And start small.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.013
And then once that works,
you can change it.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.049
And it doesn't have to be something
that was set for the entire year.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:47.353
Our block that we planned for
was six weeks ish,

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.524
and then we met again
and changed it for the next block.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:56.195
So I think having small increments
and reassessing and changing your goals,

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:56.863
changing your vision

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:01.100
a little bit was really beneficial
for our Eagle block here at Saint Mary's.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:06.439
So what I would recommend
we started at initiating, right.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.442
Every school is initiating
this project and

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:13.279
I really feel like we are
we have moved into developing and

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.649
it's it's even progressing past.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:22.455
But I think when I, when I personally
look at it, I think, okay, next year,

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:27.026
if there was new staff in the building,
could this still run as is?

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:31.364
And I think
if the teachers had the time to plan

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:36.569
and if senior teachers had the opportunity
to now, let those staff members

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.906
know how beneficial it is,
because this year we went into it blind.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.909
We didn't have anyone to say
it works really well.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.744
The kids are going to love it.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.213
It's it's going to be good.
We didn't have any of that.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:51.184
So I think moving forward now
we have people that have experienced it.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:57.190
So they will be able to help next year
if we keep those staff members

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.428
in the building and hopefully advocate
for the necessity of this.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.432
And I at other schools, I think

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.603
now that, like, we can advocate for it
and talk to other schools.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:14.073
So I think that's really important
to collaborate with schools that are also

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:18.845
participating in the LDR just to see what
they're doing, because I know

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.215
we rack
our brains and think, what can we do?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.885
But if someone's already doing it,
we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:31.057
And if it's working for them, it could
probably work for us or tweaked a little.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.158
It could work in our building.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.828
So I think collaboration,
not just with our own teachers,

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.898
but with other teachers
that want to implement

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:42.535
this in their building
is really important for this project.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.605
So right now
we're in the second Eagle block

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:48.908
that we've been doing
and my group for the whole.

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:51.344
So we have different sectors
we can choose from.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.179
And we chose outdoor learning.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.848
So right now
we are making a type of shelter.

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.217
Like there is kind of a small example.

00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:02.054
And then we're going to we have to find
all our things are in a cut.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:05.925
Like we take only fallen trees
and then we have to find our

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:10.730
like little place,
which is about 6 to 8ft length.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.267
And, right now,
like I was just cutting this tree,

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.903
we have like saws,
we have all the stuff we need.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.671
So and this is just like something we do

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.674
every Friday and Thursday
for a second period, for about an hour.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:24.744
And so far I've kind of learned
I've learned quite a bit,

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.413
like we learned how to tie
these like different types of knots.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.983
We learned,
I think three different types.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.986
So some that'll be really useful
if you ever need them.

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:37.924
So I find this is like a really good way
to, like,

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:41.494
learn some skills that you might
not just learn regularly in school.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.464
And, I think this is fun.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.832
This is like, a very fun experience

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.733
because I don't know, many like,
not my friends.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.469
I go to other schools,
they don't really do this.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.803
And it's very fun.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.338
And I like to see
a lot of people out here.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:53.873
They enjoy it. It's fun.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.642
It's a good way to like, learn,
like I said.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.745
And overall it's
just a really great experience.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:03.149
I always like to build stuff and

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:07.286
to this year
it was my first year going here.

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:11.991
So, this middle school block
sort of changed my life.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.495
So it's something new that I like.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:19.999
And also I like adventures
and grab some wood, build stuff.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.100
It's fun.
