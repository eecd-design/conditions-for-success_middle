WEBVTT

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.343
my name is Tyson McGee.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.277
I'm the English SPR

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.280
and I lead a group of Dungeons and Dragons
for the middle school.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.682
The reason I started our D

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.952
and D club is because I had children
who wanted to play D and D.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.055
So what do kids want to do?

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.890
Our school is very accommodating.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.425
We want to help people be accepting.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.495
So find out what kids love to do
and do it.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.196
Make that a reality for them.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.832
So if you have a bunch of kids
that are interested in an art club,

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.334
if you have kids
who are interested in theater,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.570
if you have kids who are interested in
something like dungeons and Dragons,

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.274
what they're interested in
is kind of your go to to start out with.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.912
So our Dungeons and Dragons group
is meant to include anybody and everybody.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.049
But it's particularly draws on kids
that don't have a lot

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.485
of social connections
through sports or other clubs or whatnot.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.654
We had a few kids
that were very charismatic.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.123
They are the storytellers
of the outgoing kids

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.092
and whatnot, and we had a couple kids
who were very shy.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.828
They wanted to be along for the ride
and let the other kids carry them.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:06.066
But as we go on, those kids start
to come out of their shells more and more.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.002
They get very excited
when something goes as planned.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.571
They're very devastated
when it doesn't go as planned,

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.073
but they've become
very emotionally involved,

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.509
and then they become the drivers of
the story just along with everybody else.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.644
The idea is to tell stories

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.114
with your with your peers,
and the rules are around building conflict

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.183
because you know, a good story
doesn't always

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.085
have you doing
exactly what you want to do.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.353
But it's about working together
and building friendship.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:32.358
And, building empathy towards one another
and getting that experience of being in

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.596
with other people and having fun playing,
pretending, making up things.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.866
Every week we have somebody who's making
sure that they want

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.103
to bring snacks and include people,
and it's very inclusive.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.972
And I see friendships of people
who wouldn't normally interact

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.275
with each other, coming together
and spending more time together.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.946
I see, those down in the cafeteria
today, for example,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.049
and I saw a bunch of kids sitting together
who I've never seen

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.052
anywhere near each other before,
but because they were in groups together,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.722
they felt more comfortable, more accepted
than their branching out

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.524
in their social circles,
which is wonderful to see.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.561
It can sound like it's very intimidating
to start any club,

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.965
and especially with D&D,
where you run the club

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.100
and you're very involved
at the beginning or whatnot.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.436
There's tons of supports for people
online.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.905
It's not as hard as people think
that it would be.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.908
Wizards of the coast is the people
who own Dungeons and Dragons.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.112
They have a bunch of different modules
for starting out with, that walk

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:26.846
somebody through

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.383
How to be a Dungeon Master, what to do
now, how to prepare for the next one.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.885
What do you be concerned about?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.586
Here are the things that might come up.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.389
There's different adventures you can do,
and each one really does walk you through

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.526
all the steps
of how to be a DM and successfully do it,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.163
and it's a lot of fun
and if you make a mistake, the number one

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.466
most important rule
is that whatever you and your characters

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.669
decide is that is the rule now,
so you can't really mess it out.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.306
So if you want to try it, if you think
kids would enjoy it, go for it.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.408
Because even if it goes wrong,
it's still probably going to go right.
