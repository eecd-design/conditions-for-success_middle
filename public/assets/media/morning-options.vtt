Hi. My name is Ivy.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.077
I go to Dr.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.080
Losier Middle School. I'm in grade six.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.017
Morning options is
where you go somewhere in the morning

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:20.053
when you get to school and you pick one.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:25.658
There's a numerals where you sign up
at the start of the term,

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.529
and you can choose
if you're on a volleyball team or soccer.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.901
And some days you have there
there's games or practices.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.304
And in the music room you can just go

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.307
with your friends and play music.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.311
And there's a culture club
where a lot of our newcomers

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.314
go to play games
and socialize with others.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.752
And when the bell rings,
you have to go back to your home room.
