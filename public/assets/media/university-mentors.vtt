00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.709
So, hi,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.613
I'm Kim, I am the behavior intervention
mentor here at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.917
And I'm going to share with you an example
of the school to community connection

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.721
about sustaining practices
of embedding school based relationship

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.191
building as a hallmark of the school's
culture and mission.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:29.229
And so here at Marshall Middle School,

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.566
we have a mentorship program
with Mount Allison University.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.003
And as a behavior intervention mentor.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:44.677
My role in that is to be very much aware
that behavior has a function.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.912
All behavior has a function.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.214
Usually
it divides into four different categories.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:52.285
One of those categories is an attachment

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.255
seeking connections
with people seeking attention.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:01:00.060
And so I am upstairs in the classrooms,
and I'm able to see a lot of the behavior

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.094
that's going on.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:05.198
And as a band, I get to work with a lot
of the overt behaviors in our classrooms.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.301
But this gives me an opportunity
to work with

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.704
some of the kids
who might not be having overt behaviors.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.606
They might not be interrupting the class.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.209
It's kiddos who might kind of
just be looking like

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.711
they need some connection
to somebody in the building.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.249
So what I get to do is

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.353
make the connection between them
and a university student,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.455
and it gives them

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.559
the opportunity to kind of shine
with somebody else who has attention,

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.763
just for them to take an interest
in what they want to be talking about,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:41.067
to be able to show interest
in the things that they're interested in

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:45.672
and just give them real one on one
connection for a whole hour every week.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.141
So it's just about them.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.144
And some of those kiddos
really need that connection.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.247
We love our neighbors.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.850
My personal reflection
is that we need to try

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.086
to make more of these connections,
especially elsewhere in other schools,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.890
because there's so many kids out there
who aren't having overt behaviors,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.027
but whose behavior is still speaking
and saying something.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.831
Those trauma sensitive practices
suggest that it's not just kids

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.902
who are misbehaving who are struggling.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.606
Some of those kids could be showing
that need for connection

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.110
by backing away,
by not necessarily seeking it as well.
