00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:08.842
So, hi.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.911
I'm Nathalie, and I'm a teacher
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.546
I teach grade five.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.282
We are the first grade
of our middle school,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.552
which is kind of different
than other middle schools.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.722
So we are the foundation that leads

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.159
the rest of their fundamental years
at middle school.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:31.865
We when we were introduced to the kids
at the beginning of the year,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.301
I really found that my kids needed

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.772
some social emotional help and work.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.510
So I'm here today to talk about our
morning mantras that I put into practice.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:48.581
For something really easy to do every day
for social emotional wellness.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.385
And I decided to put six mantras
into place.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.289
And through observations and conversations
with my kids

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.259
at the beginning of the year,
knowing their home lives.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.096
Seeing them interact with each other
and peers,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.600
other peers in the school
and teachers, adults of every sort.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.939
I had a sense of what they needed from me,
and from the morning mantras,

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.942
and from the social emotional
wellness work that we were going to do.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.680
So I decided on our six mantras through
those observations and conversations.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:25.318
So every morning
we come in and it's part of our routine

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.521
to go have a morning meeting,
and it is part of our morning meeting.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:33.460
The kids are used to saying these now,
and I put them into practice

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.498
because I wanted them to be able to use
these mantras when they are feeling down,

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:43.436
or they need some self-motivation
or calmness in their lives.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.507
So, for example, if they needed help

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:51.177
with some schoolwork,
they were struggling with a math equation.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.982
I want them to be able to reflect and say,
I am smart, I am capable, I can do this.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.017
So that's why I chose some of those.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.020
Or if they're having a problem with a peer

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.224
saying I am loved, I am important.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:08.895
Even if they're feeling like
they have trouble with another teacher

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.198
saying that
I and I have a safe environment to go to,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:16.336
and I am loved by the adults in this room,
even though sometimes they may not feel

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.339
that I want them to be able
to repeat those mantras,

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.476
when they're in a difficult,
situation to persevere through.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.578
Especially

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.581
when they're having those difficult
hard times.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.383
Repeat after me. I am strong.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.651
I am strong.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.020
I am capable, I am capable.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.922
I am love. I am love.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:36.990
I am important.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.226
I am working. I am safe. I am safe.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:44.631
So my tips and tricks for other teachers
would be to have those observations

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:45.865
and conversations

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:49.402
with your kids early on in the year,
and see what they need from you

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.805
and they need from the safe environment
that you're trying to instill.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.341
And then take what?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.278
That you feel necessary that if it's I am

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.281
loved, I am safe, I am important.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.951
And instill those in your daily practice
so that they know,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.821
even if they forget it,
maybe sometime during the day

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:12.659
or when they're in a difficult situation,
they know that they can turn

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.696
back to those mantras
and say them to themselves to really help

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.799
get through those tough
times and have some grit.
