WEBVTT

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.109
so I'm Dom

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.379
Hachey, I am the academic support teacher
literacy at Dr.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.181
Losier Middle School,
and also the literacy SPR,

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.517
which means I'm just,
in charge of the data

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.520
and the accountability
for our literacy department here.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.254
Yeah.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.056
So today
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.059
about why we found the need
for common assessment.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.528
And kind of what that process
looked like.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.799
So a few years ago, we realized that
there was some inconsistency

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.068
amongst the grade levels
from when they would graduate,

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.003
for example,
from grade six to grade seven.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.272
Some of the grade
six students got some things.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.341
Some of the other grade
six students got other things.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.945
So what we wanted to do was level that
playing field and have, some consistency.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.516
So from there, we kind of decided

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.786
what are the things
that we need to assess,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.655
that are most important to us.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.125
So what we did
was we decided that we needed to find

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.327
where the writing was at with a demand.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.429
Writing piece.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.599
We needed to find where their fluency
was with their oral reading,

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.536
and we needed to find
what their reading comprehension was.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.772
So from there,
we decided that we were going to do

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.340
beginning of the year screeners.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.542
So we have a beginning of the year

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.011
screener
for each of those three categories,

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.014
and then we test them at the end
of the year to measure the progress.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.417
From there, we also kind of decided,
based on some feedback

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:29.522
that we got from the high school that,
we needed to tighten up our writing.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.760
So what we did is we sat down as a PLC
and we decided,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.964
how do we tighten up our writing
and what are the the biggest elements

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.732
of writing that we feel
that are being missed?

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.470
So we decided that, punctuation,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.607
capitalization and sentence structure
were the real, the the real,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.810
the big factors that we,
we felt that needed to be touched up on.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.481
So we created these grammar intervention
units.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.316
Each of those runs about a month.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.319
And we pre and post
test them on the way there.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.556
And all of this data eventually
is going to be shared with the high school

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.959
so that we can communicate
what they've learned

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.328
and how they've learned it
by the time they get there.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.362
Yeah.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.799
I would say, if you're going to start

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.136
with common assessments,
you need to first decide

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:20.140
what are the biggest factors,
that are important to you.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.376
What are the what are the things of
the kids are missing?

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.613
What are the things that you feel that,
they need the most?

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.615
So for us, it was in the writing.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.750
It was communicated to us that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.053
that the writing,
needs to be tightened up a little bit.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.391
So from there, we really had to sit down
with our curriculum

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.895
and decide, what is it exactly
that we're going to teach?

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.631
How are we going to teach it,
and how are we going to communicate

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.733
the expectations to the kids?

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:51.504
So the biggest factor for for the student
learning was actually knowing

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.208
where the targets were for the kids,
and we needed to share that with them.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.278
So from there,

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:02.148
especially with the new holistic
curriculum, we sat down and redesigned

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.184
a lot of our units
based on the holistic curriculum.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.887
And it was it was a bit of a blessing
because it didn't matter if,

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.257
you know, we had one teacher
that was a 35 year teacher and one teacher

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.092
that was a first year teacher.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.462
The the the playing ground was, was level.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.500
So we sat down as a team
for about 2 or 3 days.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.968
We had some supply teachers come in,

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:25.905
and we just really sat down
and honed in what we needed, needed to do.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.975
And we made these student
friendly rubrics.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:34.914
So every single outcome and in the new
holistic curriculum is now translated

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:38.084
onto a rubric that is in student
friendly, I can statements.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.587
From there

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.590
we we take those rubrics,
we give them to the kids

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.694
and we, we,
we communicate what the expectations are.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.363
And we do that
for every single unit that we do.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.865
So if it's capitalization,
we go through the outcomes.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.201
This is exactly what's expected of you.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.203
This is how we're going to teach it.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.304
We move on.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.907
Did it do it for every unit that we have?

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.107
Yeah.
