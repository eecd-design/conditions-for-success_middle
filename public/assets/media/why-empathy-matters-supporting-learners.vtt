00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.643
Hello, middle school educators.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.446
Let's take a few minutes
to talk about empathy,

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.449
an essential skill
for teachers to model for students.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.554
Empathy is the ability to understand
and share feelings of others.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.224
It goes beyond noticing emotions.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.227
It's responding in a way that shows care
and understanding

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.462
in practice.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.631
Empathy looks like active listening.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:35.535
When a student shares a concern,
recognizing that challenging behavior

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.739
may be a response to stress
or offering support and encouragement.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.244
It also means modeling
respectful communication with colleagues

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.414
and creating classroom spaces
where students feel safe

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.617
to express themselves
by practicing empathy.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.187
We help middle level students
feel seen, heard, and valued,

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:58.691
and build a positive and supportive school
culture for everyone.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:04.364
It starts with awareness staff
who value diversity, equity and inclusion,

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:07.634
and who understand how adverse
childhood experiences

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.171
affect students are better
equipped to meet their needs.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.706
Leadership plays a key role

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.709
by modeling empathy
and reinforcing its importance.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.947
Teachers can learn about the impact
distress and trauma

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:24.117
have on students
academic and social emotional development.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.954
You can show empathy toward students
by assuming

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.990
that all students want to behave well.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.861
As Doctor Ross Green says so well, kids do
well if they can.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.365
We can also assume that students
may have been experienced,

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.902
may have experienced trauma,
even if we don't know their past.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.941
These assumptions help us respond
with understanding, patience, and support.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.543
Training is next.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.280
Staff can develop skills like active
listening, emotional awareness,

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.750
conflict
resolution, and supportive communication.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.589
Staff training around recognizing implicit
bias and being trauma informed

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.526
ensures
all students receive positive experiences,

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.662
even if they face challenges
outside of school.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.899
Applying these skills matters
as much as learning them.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.835
Checking in with colleagues.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:19.973
Incorporating empathy practices
in classrooms and noticing

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.176
students
emotional states builds trust and safety.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.880
Trauma informed approaches ensures
interactions

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.883
are supportive and empowering,
not punitive.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.685
Empathy doesn't stop with adults.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.688
Middle school is a time
when students are learning how to navigate

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.691
friendships,
group work, and social challenges.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.794
When students
practice empathy with each other,

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.098
it builds stronger
peer connections and reduces conflict.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.002
This might look like a student
noticing a classmate sitting alone

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.839
and inviting them to join a group,
or listening without judgment.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.441
When a peer share something personal,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.611
it can be as simple
as encouraging a teammate after a mistake.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:02.916
Standing up against unkind behavior
or checking in with a friend

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.851
who seemed upset.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:09.289
Teachers can help by creating routines
where students practice perspective

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.793
taking, like reflecting on how different
people in a story might feel.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:18.565
Role playing conflict resolution
or starting a class with peer check ins.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.201
These moments show

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.771
students that empathy is
not just something adults model,

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.141
but it's something that they can actively
live out with each other.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:32.745
When learners show empathy for one
another, classroom shift

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:36.182
students feel safer, relationships
grow stronger,

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.552
and a culture of kindness
becomes the norm.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.422
Finally, reflection keeps empathy alive.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:46.125
Evidence based strategies, collaboration,
and ongoing evaluation

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.462
help make sure every student feels
valued and safe.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.231
When empathy is practiced,

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:55.034
consistently achieved in school culture
where everyone can thrive.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.405
Thank you for creating classrooms
where empathy guides every interaction.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:04.444
Your work helps students feel supported,
connected, and ready to learn.
