00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.843
Hi from the St.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:10.643
Mary’s Academy Culture Club.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:15.048
The goal of the Culture Club,

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:19.486
is to make our school more inclusive
and make every culture feel recognized.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.789
One way we do this
is that we design a bulletin board

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.159
with a different country on it
every single week.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:30.230
This bulletin board includes the country's
flags, fun facts about the countries,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.233
and a list of student names
that are originally from there.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.403
Another way is that we hang our student

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.539
country's flags up in our gym,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.144
and then the last way that we do this
is that we

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.714
put welcome in many different

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.785
like languages to on our entrance doors

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.954
to make students feel welcome
when they first enter the school.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.824
This helps students gain knowledge

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.994
about other countries
and make our school more diverse.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.665
I think the purpose of the Saint Mary's
Academy Culture Club is to bring together

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:10.570
the different cultures of the school,
and by that it means to share the culture,

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.341
which means to share the food,
the traditions and the attire.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.679
And that way we can all educate each other
and live together

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.381
in a nice, diverse school.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.250
I just think it's great
that we have such a nice, diverse school.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.885
I've been to many schools before,

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.888
and I've never been at a school
quite as diverse as this,

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.691
and I think it's just wonderful
to have all these friends

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.694
and peers
that come from all over the place.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.630
What I really like about a culture club
is the fact that it includes

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.934
a lot of people, including those
that are Canadian born and raised here,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.237
because it spreads more awareness
and it includes you.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:48.074
And like the different types of activities
and traditions other cultures have.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:52.579
So I find a very important
to like increase the amount of awareness

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.450
and, you know, lessen the ignorance
some people have, which can be innocent,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.453
but it's still important to know about
the different cultures around the world.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.856
We often do potlucks, for example.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.391
This year was like a big, big potluck.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.560
The first potluck we had
was in the cafeteria.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.195
An increase in the gym.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.265
We had like a lot of like big tables
for food.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.032
And I find it

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:16.069
very interesting how different cultures
express themselves throughout their food,

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.271
how you can get a lot of insight

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.041
in their territory and their customs
and everything else is a purpose

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:27.714
is, learning about different cultures,
traditions, movie languages.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.784
I would just say
like, hello, in many languages.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.990
Also
like, we really like our culture club

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.760
because it's a way to make friends and,
like, learning new cultures.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.962
Sharing our culture.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.466
And they learn, like,
how we can, like, live together

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.701
in, like, a diversity school.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:53.239
So something I like about the Culture
Club is learning

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.876
and teaching people
about the cultures in our school.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:01.915
One big thing we learned, the Culture
Club, is cultural exchange here.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.684
Instead of changing who we are to fit in.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.386
We stay true to our self

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.489
and we learn to share who we are
and our issues with others.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.592
One example
would be the Multicultural fair,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.361
where we get the chance
to present our country or a country.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:20.133
Our choices even share food sometimes,
and some displays from me.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.936
The goal of the cultural club is to share

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.272
the real cultural from my country
traditions and customs.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.409
The real Brazil. I come from.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.742
Yeah.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:33.646
The, got of the culture from me
is also to share my culture from Europe

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.883
and also to get to know
different cultures, to know new tradition

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.986
and new people, and to know harvest
how they still live in their country.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:43.790
No, only about the language,
the parts of the new countries,

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.192
but, the foods, the customs.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:50.263
And for me, I really love learn
so about the new culture.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.731
So for me, I think it is.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:51.965
Yeah.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.300
For me, it's,
I think better to get to know new people

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.637
and to see how the people from different
parts of the world are behaving,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.472
how adapt their tradition, what they like.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:03.409
That culture club done a lot of activities
where all the students

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.114
from different countries
share our on on things like that

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:12.685
food, games
and also the community in there.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:16.122
When we share all that,
everyone is learning about it

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.993
and we like it
because we're a multicultural school

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.763
where everyone where their school is made
by different

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.433
people from the
the fam, people from different countries.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.072
And we like that
we curse is a Brazil thing in the schools.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.175
We can share with each other and stuff

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:39.178
and also, cultural things.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:44.217
So we had an occasion where we did,
a multicultural potluck in February

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:48.955
where we many people from different cars,
we cooked a meal and it's just cool.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.090
You have to disagree
with all this teacher.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.824
And it was

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.595
it was a good experience for all of us,
not only those in Culture Club,

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:59.399
but also, even parents,
even teachers had the occasion

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:04.037
to taste, really delicious foods
from around the world and, and explored

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:08.941
the economic diversity of different
cultures and different countries.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.712
What I want to tell about the Culture Club
is what I love about

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:16.349
it is the activities that we do,
for example,

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.419
the multicultural fair

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:23.323
that is coming up pretty soon,
which is on May 21st,

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.459
it is where everyone, is,

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.196
going to be going
and coming around to like,

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:34.801
look at the flags of the,
origins from their countries.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.338
There's also going to be some food

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:42.141
and what I also love about it is that,

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:47.413
we're trying to make the, school
look more inclusive,

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.516
just like what we did with,

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.119
a poster over here.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.888
We did a contest for it,

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:58.891
and some someone and I,

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.862
I love how
I truly belong in this community.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:08.434
I think, it is a great, experience
to be part of this community.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:09.302
What?

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:13.740
I truly believe that the main goal
of the Culture Club is to help newcomers

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.744
to, adjust and be welcome
within the North American culture,

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.612
especially Canada or America,

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.915
because you don't know where they truly
came from, what situation you were in.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.386
So accepting these people

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:30.656
and like a lot of them, become as
one will truly like, make them feel safe

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:34.394
and comfortable to express their culture
like values and stuff.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.329
An extension from Germany.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:40.500
And I think that the goal of the Culture
Club is to meet other people

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.534
from like also different

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.604
cultures, learn about the culture
and acknowledge the culture.

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.940
What I also like about the Culture Club
is that you meet

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.010
a lot of nice people
that then also become your friends.
