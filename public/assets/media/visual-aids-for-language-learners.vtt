00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.144
Hi, I am Jessica Welch and I

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.848
am a K to eight visual arts
specialist at Birchmount School.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.484
Hi. My name is Carole Cormier.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:21.955
I'm also, teacher at Birchmount School,
and I teach grade

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.992
seven and eight
French immersion and late immersion.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.862
First intensive French.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.699
And today we're here to discuss,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.702
our visual aid.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.172
And, the benefits of using visual aids

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.175
in language learners at our school.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.044
So in my classroom,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:48.014
it involves a lot of pictures
that go along with steps.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:52.152
So if I'm asking the students to cut,
we have the visual of the scissors.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.988
And that goes on the board
or I'm flashing.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.559
And when I'm talking about cutting
or underneath my document camera.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.531
And I do a lot of color coding for things
as well in the classroom.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.368
So my red table, they always
put everything in the red folder

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.337
and they go to the red section
when they need to grab things.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.340
So it's easier for students to understand

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.545
where their belongings go
when they're moving around the classroom.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.679
As well.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.449
Nice. And I'm bumping off that.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:26.052
I just want to share that
I worked with the early years,

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:29.823
so I was able to take a lot
of my materials from the early years.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:35.361
Feelings and, like, clothing and,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:40.600
and the kind of flash cards, big posters
in the classroom with, information.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.571
So that
when I'm discussing in the second language

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.208
that, student can look over
if if I'm pointing at a date

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:52.479
on the calendar, I can point to today
and yesterday and tomorrow.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:56.449
So, the the repetition of,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.487
the discussion, daily discussions

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:06.493
on, on subjects, can be reinforced
so that the student can remember.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.797
again, having a mix of,

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.467
French immersion
who started in the early years

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:18.605
and new arrivals, coming to our school,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:24.144
who are barely speaking English
and having to come in to a French class.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:27.714
I want to have them engage
as much as possible.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.351
So, using the visuals,

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.955
whether it could be even just drawing it
out, you know, if you're if you're

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:40.793
just working in with a small group
on, on certain skills or,

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.065
subjects that the need work on,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.437
A lot of it was just realizing that

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.274
I didn't want to talk
so much in the classroom, too,

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.343
and that they, like,
they didn't need all that language.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.346
They just
they needed to see what they were doing.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.614
And I'm a visual learner.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:06.252
So I knew that I couldn't handle
hearing all those instructions.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:10.089
I just needed to see a lot of it
to know what what I was doing.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.893
So I knew when I was doing a drawing
with the class,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.530
with the document camera,
if I'm asking them to pull out

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.700
green pastels, well,
I pull out all the green pastels

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.004
and put them underneath
so they go, oh, that's what I need to do.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.273
I need to get those out right now.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.075
I don't have to repeat it a lot.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.778
They just look up and see, okay, that's
what I'm doing.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.815
Or they hear the doorbell,
the cue to look at the TV and go, oh,

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.885
okay,
I need to do that right now, you know?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:43.256
So it was just a lot of it
is kind of the way I learned as well.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:47.794
So I was bringing that into the classroom
for me and for them.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.262
Any tips.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:54.133
Starts with small start small
because it can be overwhelming to go okay

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.136
I need a visual
for absolutely everything in my classroom.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.471
Well no you don't.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.941
And lots of visuals
can be used for different things as well.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:06.679
You can use the same like a red,
just a red card for

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:10.250
stop or a red curve for your colors,
or a red card for angry.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:14.787
So those visuals can be used in different
ways, and the students will learn that

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.155
as you use them.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.523
So you don't have to start off

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:20.960
with 100 different visuals
that can be overwhelming to
