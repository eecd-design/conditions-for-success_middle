Hi, Gloria. Arianna.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.066
Hi. Hi.

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.066
Regarding the eagle block
at Saint Mary's Academy.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:13.433
How did you feel when you were given
the opportunity to express your opinion

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:17.933
about what you wanted to learn,
and how you want to learn it?

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.833
I mean, for me, I really like it

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.133
because I get to learn, well, like Carmel,
what I want to learn.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.400
And it gives me, like, the opportunity
to see what I like

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.833
to see, like kind of what my future
is going to be like, ahead of me or what.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.966
Like I get to try my things out

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.100
and I think it's kind of like better
than just being like,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.466
stuck to regular classes,
because I feel like sometimes

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.066
in the regular classes
I get kind of bored.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:49.500
So yeah, and I and I for me,
I chose the outdoor learning

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800
because I really like being outside
and being in the woods.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700
And so I thought that
that would be what I would like.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.266
And so far
it's been what I, I've been liking

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.133
speaking for me,

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.666
like personally in my group,
which is art and sound.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.300
I like the concept of it
because they give us materials

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.466
and that are, catered, like,

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.466
catered to us, and we get to do
whatever we want with them.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.900
So like art materials
and they play music and we like,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.333
we get to like paint or felt

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.200
or like different art things
about like how we feel in the moment.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400
And I think I prefer that than
being in a class, because it gives you

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:33.633
this sense of freedom
that you don't always have in a class.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.133
Thank you.
