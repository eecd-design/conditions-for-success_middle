00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:09.909
Hi there.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.013
I'm Marie Reinsborough-Wadden,
and I'm the school counselor here

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.514
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.249
Best job in the universe.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.887
And I'm here today to talk about career
connected learning, and specifically

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.457
a really wonderful program that we have
here called Career Day at Marshview.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.993
So what it is, it's really beautiful.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.562
We're very lucky and fortunate
where we are in that

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.632
we have a very involved, larger community
than just our school.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.102
We're in Sackville, New Brunswick,
in the Tamar area, right beside Mount

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:39.906
Alice University, and so right beside Fort
Folly as well, First Nation.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.942
So we just have just
in that quick definition, you can see that

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.312
we have already automatically,
just by nature of the location,

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:51.751
so many potential invitations to invite
community members into our school.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.286
So through that,

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.389
what we've done is we've started
Career Day where students have a choice.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.091
I've had to limit it.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.494
It could be much bigger than this,
but they have a choice between 15

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:05.398
different community members who will come
into the school and share their career.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.633
Adventure is what we call it.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:10.570
So they talk about the specific role
that they have, how they came to that

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.441
role, the education that they've you know,
enjoyed that process to get there.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:18.445
They also talk about
we make sure that they talk about,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.648
how math is involved in their work,
how literacy is involved

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.682
in the work that they do.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.685
So we definitely try to embedded
into the curriculum as well.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.886
What it is,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.790
is a chance for students to look at a list
of 15 different opportunities.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.158
And there's such a wide range.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.328
We have chefs who come in,
we have different trades who come in.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.697
We have as petitions
like it's all over the place.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.365
We have lots of university professors.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.900
We're really fortunate that way.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.268
So students get to look at this list

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.972
of 15 different potential ways
that they might want to like, explore,

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.042
like that adventure
for the, for themselves.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.845
And then they're given
it's narrowed down to three.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.981
So they spend the afternoon listening to
for like 30 minutes each

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.852
as it's like a deep conversation
from a trusted mentor

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.087
about their career journey
that they have been on.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:01.955
It's beautiful.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.592
And what's really lovely about it, too,
is that students are automatically engaged

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:09.629
because they have chosen to hear
about that specific person's journey.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.663
Yeah.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.766
Well, so it's we have been doing
this program for a few years now,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.304
and my biggest reflection would be
that people want to get involved.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.307
People really want to have an open door
school, right?

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:25.612
We're really fortunate that many of
our volunteers are what they started off.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.615
We would reach out to family members,
parents, guardians, etc.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.850
to come in,
but since then it's really grown.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.220
So I already have community members
reaching out to me like, oh,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.056
I know that crater is coming up,
so I just wanted to let you know

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.825
I'm available for these dates, right?

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:43.096
So that should be like a lovely,
wonderful reflection point for me.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.198
And that once you launch a program

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.367
and then you have
if you have trust in the community,

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:51.337
it really is kind of beyond what you even
imagined, which is really wonderful. So
