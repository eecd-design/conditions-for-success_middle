00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.809
My name is Kaelie Andrews.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.812
I teach science and social studies
here at River Valley Middle School.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.882
I'm here to talk about
how I use experiential learning

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.619
in my classrooms
and especially in science class.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.923
We are very blessed
to be living in an area

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.926
that has the opportunity to go outdoors

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.630
and to use things like the vernal pond
and the streams

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.534
and the wooded area to kind of embrace
the students learning experience.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:39.239
Students are not just learning
about the earth systems.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.841
They are here experiencing them.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.779
They're able to get involved and really,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.050
explore and through different things

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.621
like data stream collection,
identifying organisms,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.224
and reflecting on what they've

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.327
seen as they go through their field walk.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:05.899
And I really feel like these hands on
moments really help deepen

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.272
their understanding and spark
real curiosity and help them really

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.643
build a connection to with what
they're learning.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.646
We have the opportunity here
to bring the outdoors in.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:24.050
So what that looks like for us
is we've set up,

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:29.556
tanks in the science lab that allows
students to make observations inside

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:34.094
so those who cannot participate outside
or have access to the pools,

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:38.698
they have access to the information
and the experience inside.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.802
Different things like cross

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.072
Cross-Curricular connections,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:52.679
taking a walk into the woods and exploring
and investigating and noticing changes

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.683
is easily turned into, activities

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.853
that include involves writing involves
math.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.188
It's very cross-curricular.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.225
We can even tie it into indigenous ways of

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.595
knowing and,
the students seem to really enjoy it.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:14.234
Beyond science, these experiments help
students grow in other important ways.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.402
They reflect on their observations.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.372
They learn to work together
through challenging tasks.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.976
They learn to see the world
through different perspectives.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:27.447
They learn to appreciate
and see the interconnectedness between

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.682
different systems.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.685
It allows them to practice listening,

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:38.591
compromising, and be thoughtful
and take thoughtful risks.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.928
They learn how to celebrate each other,
and I really encourage them

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.398
to celebrate making mistakes as well
and to learn from that.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.102
My advice would be to work at designing

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.372
lessons that make every student have ways

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:58.645
that they can access these experiences,
and different ways to

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.148
draw on their understandings.
