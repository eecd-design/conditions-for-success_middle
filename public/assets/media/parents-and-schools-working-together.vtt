00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.509
My name is Diane.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.013
I am the mother of a grade eight student
here at River Valley Middle School.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.816
I've sat on the PSC
for about three years now,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.587
and I've been on the home in school
since my son was in grade one.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:25.158
Yeah, I'm here to talk about the community
collaboration and how important it is

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.695
for schools and communities
to collaborate together and have that open

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.365
dialog and have be very transparent
with each other.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.103
I feel that it's very important
for communities and, and educators

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.040
to come together and work together,
because we're not silos.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.642
We we have the kids.
We both have the kids.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:46.413
So we need to work together
and even the community members

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.183
that maybe don't have kids in the school
are affected by the school somehow.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.086
And the school is
in fact affected by the community as well.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.989
So having the community involved in every,

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.794
every aspect of everything
that the school does and having the school

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:06.266
involved in every aspect of the community
is beneficial not only for our teachers

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.170
and our staff and our, community members,
but also for our children.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.206
Because when a community
comes behind a child,

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:17.377
the child can grow
and become a stronger person overall.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:21.281
And when the when the child sees
the community show up for them,

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.982
they're more willing to help out.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:26.119
They're more willing to
try a little bit harder.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.120
And they are.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.656
Don't feel sad
if mom or dad can't show up.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.092
They know that their community
is behind them either way.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.962
If parents wanted to get involved at home
in school, they they really should.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.399
Their children
come home with a crumpled ball of paper.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.202
And you're trying to read
what that crumpled ball of paper says.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.236
Have to contact the school.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.573
But if they're involved within the school,
you already know

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.576
what's coming up, and you can assist
with those things that are coming up.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.513
And same with the school being involved
in the community and with the parents.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.716
Having that transptransparent
open line of communication helps

00:01:56.716 --> 00:02:00.887
with, ensuring that the,
the community is aligned ahead of time.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.791
So if something's coming down the pipeline
that the district may be sending down,

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:09.329
if the the community champions
know about it, then they can spread it

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.432
within the community
and make sure it's received positively,

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.835
rather than that negative surprise.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:20.006
And then just being involved
helps with everything.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:23.143
We have our funding coming up

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.813
and we have our all of our PSC members are

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.083
also they also sit on our home in school
and they're volunteering for Fun Day.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.952
And so they get to see
all of the hard work and all of the

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.456
everything that goes into building
the child into the celebration.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.727
And, having many volunteers
helps give the teachers a moment

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:45.198
to celebrate themselves as well and ensure
that everyone is being celebrated

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:49.702
at the same time and having fun
and and just smiling and bouncing.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.238
And we shoot for the moon every year.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.707
And we we hit the moon every year.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.544
We keep going. Well,
how far can we go? Let's keep going.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.747
And it's because of our community
involvement throughout the year

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.050
that the community
also wants to celebrate with us.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:09.022
So if I have any advice for any parents
out there thinking about getting involved

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.492
or not sure on the fence
would be definitely do it.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.462
I got involved with home in school
when my son was in grade one because

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.465
he would come home and say, I'd say,
what did you learn today?

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.967
He's out, I don't know.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.735
Or he'd go, you go, what's coming up?

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.270
And you go, I don't know.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.273
And so I got involved
so that I could learn more.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.810
And I have loved every second of it.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.914
It's, the home and school,
and the school is my own little family,

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:38.952
and I've slowly grew to include

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.789
the administrators and the educators
into my own little family.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.159
And the them having that
open line of communication with them.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.330
And they know who my child is,
and they know how my parent,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.234
what my parenting styles are, and they're
comfortable contacting me now and saying,

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:58.104
okay, so here's what's happening
with your child at home, at school.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.405
Here's what we're going to try.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:03.443
And I'm comfortable going,
okay, I will continue that at home.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.546
So that having that transparency
through the fun

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.816
things helps with the transparency
through the education as well.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.421
It's really it's really, really important
that that teachers can't do it alone.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.290
The district can't do it alone.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.927
The communities can't do it alone
and the parents can't do it alone.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.862
It takes a village.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.732
It really does to do anything.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.567
It really, really does take a village.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.303
And so we are that village.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:34.307
And so when we all come together as one,
we really make

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.077
a big impact on everything and ever
anything.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.981
You have to put love into your plans
and you have to put love into your kids

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.017
and your community and your school.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:47.487
And so just ensuring
that we are spreading the love,

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:52.358
and ensuring that the community feels
that as well as our kids,

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:55.728
because they might not be your kids,
but they they still need to feel loved to.
