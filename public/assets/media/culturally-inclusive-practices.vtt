Hi. My name is Molly,

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.480
and I'm the SDL here at Birchmount School.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.515
And I'm going to be sharing about

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.785
how we're implementing
culturally responsive practices

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.355
through lessons, strategies,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.358
culture days and our heritage share.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.993
So what does it look like.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:32.499
We front load vocabulary in our lessons
to make sure that everybody is clear on

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.536
what we're what we're talking about,
and especially for our MLS.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.439
So we use lots of images.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.274
We use lots of graphics.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:45.512
And often what we'll do is
we will use their first language

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.815
so that they can leverage that
into learning new words

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.617
in their second language.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:54.087
What that looks like in social studies

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.590
is we will give them geographical terms.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.295
They can then research the meanings
of those terms in their first language,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.598
and maybe see how they apply
in their home countries.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.935
And then we apply those terms in English

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.938
to landforms that we have here in Canada.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.442
So that's one specific strategy
that we use.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:19.079
Right now we're working towards
having our heritage fair,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.048
and we had really good success with it
last year.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.852
The students
take an aspect of their own culture.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:31.124
They research it and they prepare
a trifold poster board, which then

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.595
we display, and the rest of the school
comes to take a look at it.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:40.433
Last year was a huge success,
and this year we're building on that idea

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:45.905
by, inviting members of our community
in to share their ideas.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.309
So we're looking at having sports
demonstrations.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.711
We're looking at having different
community groups

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.048
come in to share
about their own cultural practices,

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.017
and making it into
more of a community event.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.754
Another thing that we do

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.325
here at the school really
well is we have ongoing culture days,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:10.997
where students are encouraged to dress
in their traditional clothing,

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.601
and we'll have different events
that go on at the school

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:18.238
to celebrate different
all the different cultures in our school.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.142
really concentrate
on doing some self-reflection so that

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:27.046
you are aware not only of your own biases,
but of your positionality

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:31.818
within your school's power structure
and within your community power structure.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:37.090
I think doing
that makes you more of an ally and also

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.058
isn't.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:44.164
It inspires you then to make space
for other people's contributions

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:49.669
and to see potential in different areas
where you may not have seen it

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.939
before or where where you may not have
been looking for it before.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.008
So once you're aware

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.778
of your own lens
that you look at the world through,

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.948
you can then really encourage other people
to step up

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.685
and share their,
contributions and their culture.
