00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:09.442
Hi, I'm Rachel

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.812
Sullivan and I teach at Fundy Middle
and High School,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:18.051
and I teach the grades six, seven,
eight and grade ten French immersions,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.521
and I have been teaching at Fundy
for 26 years.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.224
Every year the French immersion students.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:29.295
So starting in grade six
up until grade 12, they have a French

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.799
immersion like a francophone project
that they would do.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.969
And the topics are related
to the curriculum

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.873
that they would see in social studies
or even in French.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.875
Some of the readings they would do,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.146
but it is an opportunity
to connect with the community.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.382
So we have members of the community
come in as judges,

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:54.087
so their project gets displayed,
and then they are

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.891
evaluated by judges from the francophone
judges from the community.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.927
The presentations done in French,
they're judged in French.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.296
And it's done in the gym.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.664
So it's nice.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.699
And we invite the community members
to come in,

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.470
their parents, whoever they want
to bring in to see their projects.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.971
And when they are judged,

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.974
they also have the opportunity
to go visit the other grades.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:20.280
So it's basically they're taking ownership
of the French culture

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.850
and kind of displaying that
for the community to see.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.919
We decided to do this.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:30.457
I believe we started like 15
ish 20 years ago.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.460
And it's been a tradition
that we've kept going,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.728
and it's basically
to provide our French immersion

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.932
students the opportunity
to speak French outside of the classroom

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.402
and to somebody other than their French
immersion teachers.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:47.140
It's kind of an authentic French
immersion experience for them.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.010
We are in a, small community.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.314
We don't always have the occasion
to practice our French outside

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.249
of the classroom.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.553
So this provides them with the opportunity
to speak French

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:01.855
outside of the classroom,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.658
in our community, because we invite
community members to come here.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.862
It's not like we're in Moncton,
where we can take a group of students

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:12.298
and go to a restaurant and say like,

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:16.302
okay, today we're going to practice
that ordering in French.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:20.306
So for us, in order to do that,
because we're a small community

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.711
that's lives
farther away, to the bigger cities.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.947
So this is our way of kind of

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.184
providing them
like a real life experience.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:36.322
It's nice to see kids
take an interest in the French culture,

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.459
and it is a nice little project.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.363
They can create a PowerPoint
so they can have their laptop

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:48.835
as their PowerPoint that just plays,
or they do a trifold board.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:54.541
And really, it's super easy, ties into the
curriculum and the kids really enjoy it.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.111
It's just a lot of fun,
and the students are so proud

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.247
to display their projects
like The eye of the sexes.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.850
So they had no idea what to expect.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.085
And they presented last night.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.088
They were so nervous yesterday,
but today they were like,

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.124
oh, you're right, it's no big deal.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.825
We had a lot of fun and it was.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.360
They really enjoyed the fact

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.663
that they were able to speak French
to somebody else.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:20.567
Like we had RCMP members
here, supply teachers

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.302
like, would come in
and speak French to them.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:25.305
So it was nice for them
to make connections with other people

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.441
in the community that maybe if they see
at the grocery store,

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.444
they will continue to speak French,
which is awesome,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.249
but it just it's it's good
that they were able

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.788
to, have a sense of relief
that it is a big project,

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.225
but it's it's also nice to show off

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.494
their work to their parents
and members of the community.
