00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.777
Hi. My name is Emily Nolan.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.879
I'm a grade six French teacher.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.414
My name is Emily Briggs.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.717
I'm a middle school science
and social studies teacher and a video

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:18.651
teacher as well.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.021
We teach at Birchmount school.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:21.588
Okay.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.391
So we're here today
to talk to you about empathy

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.394
and what that looks like
in our classrooms.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.964
In my classroom, it takes place
in a couple different settings.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.067
So we both teach, a lot of social studies
in a lot of health.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.437
So in my classroom,
it takes place in some questioning,

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.873
making sure that we're asking
big questions.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.809
A lot of kids have, a lot of kids

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.713
have some thoughts, like preconceived
thoughts or understandings coming in.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:51.284
So they may ask certain questions that
probe other people's opinions that pop up.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.185
And so we're just working

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.488
through those questions
and making sure that we get a well-rounded

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:58.491
understanding and making sure that we're
empathetic to a lot of those views.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.728
In my classroom,
that looks like role play.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.065
So it could be activities
where students have the opportunity

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.102
to kind of see things
from the perspective of someone else

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.106
and work through that and see kind of how
that changes their opinions on things.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.310
like, when they're expressing themselves,
we have it.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.012
It can look different in a lot of ways.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:24.350
So making sure that how they act
will always have this foundation of,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.821
like, understanding other people
and understanding how they relate

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:32.258
and how they communicate with others
matters and making sure that they're

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:36.062
creating a safe space, a safe environment
that is inclusive to everyone.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.365
And like I think we have a lot of students
coming in with a lot of

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.236
ideas and beliefs,
and I think sometimes providing them

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.807
a safe space to kind of navigate those
with like factual information and

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.243
kind of like safe adults, and

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.246
also creating a safe space for them
to talk about that with their peers.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.047
It's really important.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.049
I think we're both doing that
in our classrooms.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.085
That safe spaces, something that like,

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.423
I, we both, really put an emphasis
on making sure that,

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:07.994
the kids in our room
are not just learning.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:11.064
They're not just here to be practicing
education.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.566
They're not just here
for the academic piece.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.969
Like,
our job is not only to be their teacher,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:22.275
but to help them build and become,
people that will eventually be in society

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.279
and have a job to interact
constantly and understand

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:30.884
different point of views and be able
to support and communicate effectively

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.020
and just be we're teaching them
as their whole.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.456
We're trying to get them
as well-rounded as possible.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.158
By the time they leave our classrooms

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.860
into the next one,
into their next steps of life.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.863
And students are also really quick
to talk about their rights,

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.633
but we always like,
have a conversation as well.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.736
Okay, you do have rights, but
with those rights comes responsibility.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.504
And how do we navigate that together?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.141
How do we make sure that everyone is able
to have those rights without forgetting

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.509
the responsibility? Piece?

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.313
So some tips for empathy in the classroom.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:03.483
It's really having an understanding
that it's not something

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.920
that you need to be planning
this huge, extravagant lesson.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.588
It's very much in your day to day
teaching,

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.490
the expectations you have of students,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.091
the expectations you have of yourself,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.460
and kind of the interactions
that you allow in the room

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.463
and what is and isn't acceptable.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:20.600
I'll just add to that is,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.603
making sure that as teachers, we like,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.707
we use the words earlier,
making sure that we're treated,

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.777
that they're treating each other
how they want to be treated.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:31.811
And same goes for us.

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.848
Like if we show them the skills,
if we show them how we want to be treated,

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:36.983
it helps them understand that.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.619
So so that modeling piece model,
absolutely.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.089
Making sure that they're seeing
what it looks like to be empathetic,

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.693
what it looks like to communicate
effectively to making it like helping them

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.896
just build those foundational skills and,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.899
yeah, helping them
see each other as real people.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.002
And I think earlier we talked to about,
this is kind of off track,

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:59.272
but we talked earlier about,
the jokes in middle school

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.275
and how sometimes,
like if you come at it from, like,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.777
more of a, like a punishment lens,
like you shouldn't be joking about that.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.511
That's not funny.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.014
That doesn't help them
kind of find the understanding of

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.617
why something they say
might not actually be funny.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.052
And it's actually harmful.
It just doesn't affect them.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:15.955
And that is like a really important piece
I find in middle school,

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:19.092
just to kind of have them understand
the perspective of other people.
