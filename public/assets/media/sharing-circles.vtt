00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.112
Hi. I'm Lucy, and
I'm the guidance counselor here at Port

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.913
Elgin Regional School.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.450
And I'm here to talk to you today
about classroom circles.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.388
So, a couple years ago,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.824
admin, Allocated guidance.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.328
Half an hour a week in each classroom
to do a classroom circle.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.096
So that's how it came about.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.733
And I just didn't
ever really do a circle before.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.369
So I had to do some research on
how to do it.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.606
And then admin just let me run with it.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.674
So that's been really fun.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:46.279
So what a classroom circle looks like is
I will I have half an hour.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.914
I will go in.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.749
Every circle is kind of laid out the same.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.585
So students know what to expect.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.386
I'll go in.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.156
I'll start everyone
sitting in a circle already.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.759
I'll start with, a meditation

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.663
or a visualization

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:08.134
or a breathing exercise of some kind,
just to ground everyone and get

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:12.272
everyone ready to ready for circle
and bring them into the present.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.141
Then we'll review cycle expectations.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.211
So my expectations are that students will,

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.981
oh, only
one voice in the circle at a time.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.984
So that's the student
with the talking piece that is sharing.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.588
Students should speak from the heart
and listen from the heart.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:32.592
So what that kind of means is that
students will kind of speak their truth,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:37.897
and that they'll listen respectfully
to others and non-judgmental.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.866
You just be like, oh, that's kind of cool.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.434
That's different from how I feel.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.603
But that's okay.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.606
Or it could be
the same as other students feel.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:50.410
And then also that this is a safe space.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.779
So what's said in
the circle stays in the circle.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.080
So they shouldn't be like making fun

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.117
of what people have said on the playground
or anything like that.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.489
And then after we've talked
about circle expectations, we will do.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.592
I would you write the question
which is very important.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.162
The students love the
would you rather question.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.731
So for example, or what good
would you rather question?

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.066
I usually get the kids to help me

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.235
come up with them
because they're a lot more creative.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.402
The lawyers.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:21.274
So, the best one I ever had was
would you rather, be a dolphin

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:28.181
with a giraffe neck or,
tiger that can fly and breathe fire.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.918
And so you just pass the time piece
rounding.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.286
Just say which one you draw. That.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.355
And if you'd like to share why,
you can share.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.323
Why after that.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.293
That's when we get into more
of the more deep nitty gritty stuff.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:44.164
So this year, I've done a lot of,
self-esteem

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.133
because it's not we noticed
that's something that needs that,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.004
we would like to raise

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.007
in the building, like,
but between students.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.276
So we've talked a lot about self-esteem.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.446
So for example, in the older years,
we might if we're doing

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:05.285
a circle of self-esteem, we might watch,
maybe related to social media.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.521
So we might watch a video, on

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:12.225
an advertisement or a picture
that's been really edited

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.427
and doesn't look like the original person.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:18.198
And then we'll talk about, like,
how it makes you feel, or if you feel

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.502
that you have to edit your pictures
before posting on social media or,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.875
if if you feel like you compare yourself
to others online

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.977
or have to compare like just general

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:35.281
how you're feeling kind of things
and we just share and everyone's

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.685
encouraged to share, but they can pass
if they want so they don't have to share.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:43.189
And then I'll end the circle
with the silly boy usually.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.824
So I have this little bowl that

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.494
that sings, and students close their eyes
and we listen to the singing ball.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.698
And then when they can't hear it anymore,
they they open their eyes.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.701
And that's how we end the circle.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.402
Yeah.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.273
Some tips and tricks
I have for circle would be invite

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.610
the teacher or actually add to that
any adult in the room.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.981
Because kids, believe it or not, like,
really want to get to know you.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.551
You don't have to share anything too
personal, but, it's great modeling.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.886
If you can share how you're feeling too.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:17.790
And it also builds connections
with the students, too.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.860
So maybe at the start of the year,
it would be great to ask some like

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.528
get to know your questions. Like who?

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.531
Your favorite singer is
or if you have a favorite movie.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.835
So kids really get to know each other
and the teacher as well.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.770
So they love that. That would be a tip.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.140
Also,
it's a great way to model for teachers

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.576
if they ever want to do a classroom
circle,

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:40.146
then they can lay it out
exactly how I had it laid out.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.482
So they can do one at any time.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:47.220
And oh,
bring a variety of talking pieces.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.456
So I have like a little bag
that I carry and kids know

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.459
if I'm coming down the hall with my bag
all this way and go into a circle.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.730
And I have different talking pieces,
like stuffies.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.668
I have,
this little, like, bird, wooden bird.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.704
I try and do a few nature things,
so there's maybe a pinecone in there,

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.707
a stick that I could give me, and a rock.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:11.577
And I just lay them out
in the middle of the circle on a scarf.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:18.484
And kids can use that to look at,
if it's like a heavy topic.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.919
And they don't want to make eye contact.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.158
Or maybe their culture is, doesn't
encourage eye contact, and they can just

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.194
look at the talking pieces
in the middle of the circle while

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.864
while the group is discussing.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.600
And I also have a student pick
a talking piece too,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.603
so they can pick whichever
talking piece that they want.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.573
They're also welcome to bring their own
talking piece to put in the middle

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.474
if they would do so.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:44.977
But my rule is once it goes in the middle,
it stays in the middle.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.713
You can't touch the talking pieces.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.784
And another tip that I have

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:56.255
would be
it might be a little bit awkward at first.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.158
Kids aren't really used
to sharing circles.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.894
And at first
you might get a lot of passes

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.931
if it's not a super fun question
like more deeper ones.

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:08.768
But by the end of the year, kids
know what to do

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.604
and they are very more comfortable
sharing.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:14.240
And yeah, so stick with it.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.810
And they're very disappointed
if you don't do a circle like they

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.646
they say they don't want to do a circle,
but they look forward to it.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:20.947
It really.
