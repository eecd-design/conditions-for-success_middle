00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.509
Alicia Porter, grade seven

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.512
language arts and social studies
at George Street Middle School.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.415
I'm here to talk about
the cultural diversity

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.418
and how that kind of drives,
how we structure classes.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.355
So we have a very diverse
group of students at George Street.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:26.593
So we try to take their interests
and their,

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.563
experiences in life
and kind of bring them into the classroom

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.768
so that everyone kind of has,
a feeling of belonging in our classrooms.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.339
The stage is always open for them to share
anything that they would like to share,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.976
about their, their culture
or their religion.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:47.414
This year during Ramadan,
I had a few students asked me

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:51.484
if they could speak to the class
about about Ramadan and about it,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.090
and it ended up that they ended up talking
to other classes about Ramadan and eat

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.694
so that students from that kind of
had an understanding of, you know,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.698
why wasn't the student eating lunch
with us when everyone else was eating?

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.902
And it kind of like developed
a big conversation in our class,

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:13.139
and it was like a two hour conversation
during one of my social studies classes.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.809
Just un students asking questions.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.646
And I think you really kind of build
a bridge between different cultures

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.949
by just having understanding
and giving them that platform to talk.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.986
And it's good too, for,
yeah, all students as well,

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.090
because if they don't have the language
to express,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.692
you know, things
that they might want to share,

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.794
there's usually somebody else
in the class who does.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.698
So they also, you know, in a way
feel seen and heard as well

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:42.202
because somebody else is speaking
on their behalf and letting other people

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.973
know things that perhaps that they would
like to themselves be able to share.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.007
Well, I love it.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.777
I've always loved social studies
and learning about different cultures.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.080
So for me to have the kids
kind of take the lead on,

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.684
you know, different things,
like they know right from the get go that

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.986
they have something they want to share
or talk about.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.289
They most definitely have the floor
and the opportunity to do that.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.925
And I find like once
you get a couple kids doing it,

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.528
then more kids are like,
oh, can I talk about this?

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.662
Can I talk about that?

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.898
And it's really good
because these kids are bonding over

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.934
a lot of similar experiences
that maybe they wouldn't have known

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.169
were there before

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.837
because they were
from different countries,

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.773
or perhaps speak different languages
or different religions.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:25.345
So it's it's really nice to see the,
the growth that your class

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:29.816
kind of demonstrates through,
you know, this open platform,

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.953
speaking about anything that kind of,
you know, is meaningful to them.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.122
Children especially are

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:39.259
afraid sometimes of the unknown,
not afraid

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.262
that they just won't approach it
because they don't really know how.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:47.600
So when you know a group of students
get up and talk about why they wear hijab,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.403
then the students are like,
oh, well, now we know.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.704
And it's not an unknown.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.639
We know now.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.642
And you know, in turn,
they can also educate other people.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:58.545
So it's kind of a has a snowball effect.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:01.080
It's nice
when you see them asking questions

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.284
and really thoughtful questions
as well to their peers.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:09.589
I would say just start with conversations
and try to implement like when we like,

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.426
we don't do one off things like
we don't just talk about black history

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.229
during Black History
Month. We don't just talk about,

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.366
you know, First Nations

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.603
during in, around
Reconciliation Day in September.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.340
Like, we we try to just embedded
in our everyday lessons.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.043
So we search out articles
from different countries.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.913
We search out, books
that are culturally diverse.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.516
We invite people into our classrooms
to talk,

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:40.954
we give the students the floor to educate
because I'm not the professional.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.155
I grew up here. Right.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:46.092
So if they can come up
and talk about their country or something

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.227
that's relevant to them,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:51.297
then that's it just enriches
everybody in the room, including myself.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.601
I think I learn more from the students

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:58.104
and they will ever learn from me,
and they learn so much from each other.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.506
So students who once were shy
at the beginning of the year

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:04.444
are now more open and are willing to work
in groups with different people,

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:09.115
and they're not seen as being different
because, you know, they're new or

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:12.585
they don't dress the same as somebody else
who speak the same languages.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.655
So it's just nice to see the growth
overall in the classroom.
