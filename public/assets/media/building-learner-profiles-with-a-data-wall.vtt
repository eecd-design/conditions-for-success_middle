00:08.200 --> 00:09.566
So my name is Stefan Martin.

00:09.566 --> 00:12.800
I'm a 6 to 8 math teacher,
here at Port Elgin Regional School.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.866
I've also done a little bit of work
as the acting vice principal,

00:15.866 --> 00:17.400
over the past year.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.966
And I'm here to talk to you
about the data wall that we use.

00:19.966 --> 00:21.966
And we use it for two purposes.

00:21.966 --> 00:25.666
Number one, the purpose of the data wall
is school wide, so it's run K to eight.

00:25.666 --> 00:26.966
We're K-8 school.

00:26.966 --> 00:29.000
And then our middle school team

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
has serves a secondary purpose
with it for our PBL.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.533
So the data wall itself
is just an Excel spreadsheet,

00:35.566 --> 00:37.366
with a tab for each of our grades.

00:37.366 --> 00:40.733
And on that sheet
is a list of the students, that we have.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.266
And essentially
it's their learner profile.

00:43.266 --> 00:45.633
So all of the information
about the number of students

00:45.633 --> 00:48.166
that are enrolled in CNY,
the students that are in foster care,

00:48.166 --> 00:52.633
the students that are on our meal program,
Plps, students that require

00:52.633 --> 00:54.333
additional support
might be seeing the guidance

00:54.333 --> 00:57.333
counselor might be receiving tier
two interventions from her ASD.

00:57.566 --> 00:59.766
All that information
is just there in a checklist,

00:59.766 --> 01:01.400
something that's really easy to read

01:01.400 --> 01:04.700
and really easy for a teacher to look at
and just get a snapshot.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.966
The other pieces that are
there are our report card

01:07.966 --> 01:09.766
rates for literacy and numeracy,

01:09.766 --> 01:12.900
because those are direct,
reflections of our CIPs.

01:13.233 --> 01:16.100
As well as our district improvement
goals, things that we're working really

01:16.100 --> 01:18.100
heavily on is reading,
writing and numeracy.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.866
So we wanted to track that data
from the report cards.

01:20.866 --> 01:22.400
And the other piece is the screener data.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.433
So whether it's district screener
or diagnostic in-house screener

01:26.433 --> 01:30.033
or diagnostic assessments, all those
assessments go into this tracker.

01:30.333 --> 01:33.766
So essentially in a nutshell,
it's a one stop snapshot

01:34.066 --> 01:37.066
of what does that class look like
as a whole.

01:37.433 --> 01:38.066
in essence,

01:38.066 --> 01:40.766
if I were to go out
for an extended period of time,

01:40.766 --> 01:43.033
could I supply teacher, come in,
take a look at that profile

01:43.033 --> 01:46.133
and gain a good understanding of these
are the students that are in front of me.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.566
This is the reality that they live.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.800
And these are the challenges
that they're facing.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.000
These are the things I'm going
to need to keep in mind.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.900
This is the reality.

01:54.900 --> 02:00.000
So, that's kind of the, the, the essence
of what it is and what it looks like.

02:01.766 --> 02:03.633
The way it's used is that at

02:03.633 --> 02:07.733
PLC meetings, at s meetings,
the profile, is always accessible.

02:07.733 --> 02:11.100
So we have that information
at our fingertips after reporting periods.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.333
After screener periods,

02:12.333 --> 02:15.466
we'll take a look at the profile
and see how classes stack up.

02:15.466 --> 02:19.066
See how k to two out of 3 or 5, 6 to 8,

02:19.366 --> 02:24.000
how those different, cohorts of kids,
stack up in terms of our results.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.833
So we might compare report card grades.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.700
We might see how many students are at a
three at a

02:27.700 --> 02:31.566
two versus provincial assessments,
how many students are at a three at a two.

02:31.733 --> 02:35.033
So we can kind of see our,
our results there.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.400
We can look at our teacher efficacy.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.066
We can look at our assessment
models, and see are we on track.

02:40.166 --> 02:44.033
It's just a way of tracking that necessary
data to be an accountable school,

02:44.033 --> 02:47.933
a functional school in a school that's
using its data because there's nothing

02:48.900 --> 02:51.433
like if you use the data, there's no point
keeping it.

02:51.433 --> 02:54.766
So for me, the classroom
profile was a way of collecting data

02:54.766 --> 02:57.766
that's commonly stored in several files.

02:57.966 --> 03:02.033
Maybe it's stored in an Excel file, maybe
it's in the cloud, maybe it's by hand.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.166
So it was a way of

03:03.166 --> 03:06.166
consolidating information
and having it ready at your fingertips.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.733
What I've learned through this process
really is that,

03:12.366 --> 03:17.400
I created the Excel file, but
I had very little understanding of Excel.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.300
I've just always enjoyed the program
because it's very easy.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.166
It's very functional.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.733
So I did do a lot of learning, of Excel.

03:23.733 --> 03:25.833
So if somebody were to create
that profile,

03:25.833 --> 03:29.600
for their own school, whatever medium
you use, if it's Excel or something else,

03:31.233 --> 03:31.633
being

03:31.633 --> 03:36.033
open to learning that profile or that,
that medium, being open to asking for help

03:36.033 --> 03:39.800
because I've, I've had to ask for help
a lot of times, for Excel.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.000
That's been a huge, a huge piece
because a lot of the teachers

03:45.000 --> 03:46.700
will come to me and say, well,
how do I code this?

03:46.700 --> 03:49.366
How do I make this turn yellow?
How do I make this turn blue?

03:49.366 --> 03:50.300
I have this test.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.933
I have the screener that I want
in my classroom profile.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.633
How do I make it do this
so that I don't have to spend hours

03:56.633 --> 03:58.133
and hours coding it myself?

03:58.133 --> 04:01.266
So I've been trying to answer all
those questions for the teachers as well.

04:01.266 --> 04:04.566
So having that kind of understanding
of the medium is really important.

04:05.066 --> 04:10.866
My next step with this is kind of,
I'm always I'm always cognizant

04:10.866 --> 04:15.466
of the tracker in the way that I don't
want it to overload teachers because

04:16.566 --> 04:16.900
having too

04:16.900 --> 04:20.533
much data is also as devastating
as having not enough data,

04:20.800 --> 04:23.666
because if you're not going to analyze it,
there's no point.

04:23.666 --> 04:27.033
So if the trackers overburdened with data,
if we have too much,

04:27.166 --> 04:28.733
it's not going to serve its purpose.

04:28.733 --> 04:32.000
So I'm always aware of what we're tracking
and asking.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.500
PLC is asking teachers on a regular basis
do you need this data?

04:35.500 --> 04:38.000
Do you even want this
on the classroom profile?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.733
If not, we'll get rid of it.

04:39.733 --> 04:40.933
And then asking them also,

04:40.933 --> 04:43.933
what are the things that you would like
on the classroom profile?

04:43.966 --> 04:48.033
An example for me is I'm, I'm currently,
thinking of ways

04:48.033 --> 04:50.500
to kind of track the math results
as the math teacher

04:50.500 --> 04:52.966
after the students leave our school
in, in high school.

04:52.966 --> 04:56.800
So one of the measures I'm interested in
is seeing how many students are self

04:56.800 --> 05:00.500
streaming them out,
of like higher level math.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.900
How many students get to grade 11 and say,

05:02.900 --> 05:04.466
no, I don't think I'm ready for calculus,

05:04.466 --> 05:07.466
or I don't want to take calculus
or pre-calculus, for example.

05:07.566 --> 05:11.133
So I'm interested to see how many students
are not enrolling

05:11.133 --> 05:14.700
in those precalculus courses to see,
oh, are they not doing that

05:14.700 --> 05:15.933
because they're not interested in math?

05:15.933 --> 05:18.166
Or is it
because they don't feel ready for math?

05:18.166 --> 05:19.766
Because those are things
that we can address

05:19.766 --> 05:22.766
at a middle school level,
both the preparedness and the interest.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.800
And that's just kind of one measure.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.800
So looking at the data of the kids
when they leave, and how do we

05:29.000 --> 05:33.033
then track that data
so that we can intervene earlier?

05:33.133 --> 05:36.066
Because at the end of it,
the the main goal is to have

05:36.066 --> 05:39.200
a student in kindergarten eight years
later have eight years of data.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.066
We can see the trends,
we can see the spikes.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.533
We can see the the highs, the lows.

05:42.533 --> 05:45.200
We can see who they were
and when and if something's

05:45.200 --> 05:47.833
going wrong in high school,
if they're not on track to graduate.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.833
We can have a look back at their
their profile and say,

05:50.833 --> 05:52.400
we should have intervened here.

05:52.400 --> 05:57.266
We should have done this here so that
the next time we can we can do that.

05:57.300 --> 06:01.633
It's all about kind of understanding
our learners and, using the data

06:01.633 --> 06:04.766
that we all know and the data
that we all have and making it easy.
