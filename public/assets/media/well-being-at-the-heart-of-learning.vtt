Hello, middle school educators.

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's take a few minutes to talk about
wellbeing at school.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.250
Wellbeing isn't just a nice to have.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.552
It's a must have for learning.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:23.256
Michael Flynn says wellbeing and belonging
aren't extras.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:26.726
They are at the very heart
of learning and achievement.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.829
So what is wellbeing?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.265
According to the World Health
Organization,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.434
it's more than mental health.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:38.138
It's about growth,
thriving and helping students develop

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.875
a positive sense of identity,
social emotional skills,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.845
confidence and learning,
and the ability to reach their potential.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.616
Middle school is a key time for this.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.620
Promoting wellbeing means
creating a school environment where

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.725
both students and staff feel positive,
resilient and purposeful every day.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.830
Schools that focus on wellbeing also build
cultural competency

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.233
and inclusivity with students, families
and the broader community.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.003
As you know, this starts with you.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.040
Students
notice when teachers genuinely care.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.876
So continue
to give a greeting at the door.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.213
Ask about their weekend
and tune in to their emotions.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.115
This matters.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.618
These small acts
help students feel seen, heard and valued.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.423
Strong relationships build trust and
safety, which are essential for learning.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:36.062
When students are stressed, their learning
brain's essentially switch off.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.065
So executive functions
like problem solving, pause.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.735
You can help by maintaining
clear communication,

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.005
teaching and modeling simple calming
strategies,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.741
and setting clear routines.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.311
Intentional planning also matters.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.813
Set up your classroom for movement.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.817
Hands on learning and opportunities
for students to explore independently.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.754
Middle schoolers are figuring out
how to fit in while

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.992
also trying to stand out,
and your support helps them flourish.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.562
Thank you for creating spaces
where students

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.866
can grow, thrive, and feel truly seen.
