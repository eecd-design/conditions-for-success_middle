00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.110
My name is Lilah.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.877
I'm in grade eight.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.446
I'm from Port Elgin Regional School.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.447
My name is Cai.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.450
I’m in grade 8 at Port Elgin
Regional school.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.520
At our school, we do student council.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.456
And at the beginning of the year
they fill us in

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.558
and then we get given roles.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:29.729
And our role in some council
is to decide activities

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.932
and plan everything
that's going on around the school.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:36.169
So like dances and, parties

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:40.407
and these extra things that happen
like, games

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:45.078
and whatever is going on around school
spirit days and stuff like that.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.048
And we meet, once a week,
and the whole school

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.917
meets every first Tuesday of the month.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.320
And we meet
and we talk about these things.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.325
We make posters and we it's
very inclusive, an amazing event.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.193
We do.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:02.629
I feel like

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.332
it's important to me
because I'm out of my bubble mind

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.437
and I speak more, and I use my voice,

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.074
and I speak my own opinions and decisions,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.843
and I feel like it's important
for everyone

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.913
because you get to meet new people,
especially if you're a student

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:24.651
and you get out of your problem
like a lion might get educated more.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.621
And you also learn
how to be more respectful and as well.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:33.026
So I think extra activities are important
so that you can learn

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:37.363
more about the outside world
and what your future career could be like.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.598
And these things

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.768
that we might not have access
to at our homes or in our communities,

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.472
that we can come to school
and we can have access to these things,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:51.311
no matter how much money you make
or all these things, it's very inclusive

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.281
and it doesn't matter what race you are,
what everything in the school is very

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.650
diverse and I like that.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.520
I feel

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.523
like it's important for other schools

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:08.561
because I feel like,
you learn more about yourself

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.798
and other people and the world around you

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.201
and how you to might improve

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.204
on what you want to improve in life,

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.773
and hopefully in your career.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:25.979
And I will say, and your school work
and as well and these activities,

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:31.551
I feel like
you should be more confident and.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.489
I would encourage other schools to do this

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:41.161
act these activities or these learning

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:46.699
extra things that we do,
because it's a great way for kids

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.837
to learn
more about what's happening in the world.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.841
And what's happening like in their school,
in their community and everything.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.844
And, it's very inclusive and

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.813
it is a great program.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:05.385
Everything that we do
and happy for us is really great,

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.488
and it's a great way
to like, learn more things.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:09.756
Right.
