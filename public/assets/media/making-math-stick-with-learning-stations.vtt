00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.642
My name is Courtney Grandy.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.977
I am a resource teacher

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.980
at George Street Middle School, formerly
a grade seven math teacher.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:18.118
I am here to talk about teaching
through stations in the math classroom.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.753
So when you are

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.223
covering any sort of topic,
you can plan a lot of different practice

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.260
activities that are quick and easy,
to prep and to plan.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.498
And you have different activities at each
different station area in your room.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.934
So it provides students
with a lot of different variety of things.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.971
So one station might be a physical puzzle,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.708
putting different questions and answers
together to form a puzzle.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.413
Another station could be a quick,
worksheet that you work on.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.481
Different questions on there
with the group.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.718
Another station could be
that you're at a group with the teacher.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.554
They're walking you through a mini lesson.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.191
Instead of being a full lesson
with the whole class,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.561
another station could be using whiteboard
materials.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.064
And another station
could just be task cards. And

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.434
there's so many different other activities
you can fall into the mix there.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.871
But it's really helpful for students
to see multiple different representations

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.775
of the same topic in the same concept,
and to practice it

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.110
in a lot of different ways.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.080
It's helpful for the students
because it does provide some movement

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.015
as you move from station to station.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.950
It does provide some structure.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.387
So when you are at your station,
there's always an instruction

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.122
page to follow so that you can see

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.459
exactly what the activity is
and what the expectation is.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.095
It does provide for group work.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.098
It does provide for different leveled
activities to happen

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.267
when students come to the teacher station.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.003
The mini lesson might be different
from group to group,

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.340
so you might have a group of high fliers
come to you at one point where

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.578
you might be doing some kind of bonus
activity or enrichment activity with them,

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.714
but the next group coming through
might be a group of students

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.984
on adjusted plans, and maybe you're
just looking at the basics with them.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.422
So I find when students get to see
a concept in multiple different ways,

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:06.159
it does allow them to see real world
applications of things.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.229
It does allow them to see
just the basic application of things.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.266
And seeing it in a variety of
different ways really does make it stick.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.636
And I do find that
students have more success

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.973
the more ways that they can see
the one topic I would suggest

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.976
to practice the expectations
with students first.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.346
I usually in the first week of school,
would have students

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.516
rotate through stations
that were really low risk.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:34.554
So it could just be moving through
a math survey to see how we like math.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.324
The next station
could just be a tangram puzzle.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.193
The next station could just be,

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.897
different little math games
that you have available in your classroom.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.199
So it's just a way to teach students

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.736
how to move through stations
and what the expectations are.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.972
And then you can start layering in your,

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:56.609
content stations
in your subject specific stations.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.546
I do find the practice
first is very important.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:04.651
I do find when you're doing stations, it
is helpful to reach out to your SS team.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.288
There were multiple times that I would
reach out to my resource teacher

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.824
when I was in the classroom or my admin,
and just give them the heads up.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.793
I'm going
to be running stations on this day.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.563
If you are available to come in
and help out, great.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:21.167
And having an adult at each station,
if possible was very helpful.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:25.772
But if you don't have that extra support,
then doing that practice ahead of time

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.240
will absolutely help that person.
