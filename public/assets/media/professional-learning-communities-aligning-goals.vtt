00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.766
I'm Lindsey Turner.

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.900
I work at doctor Losier
Middle School in Miramichi New Brunswick,

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.266
and I am our math SPR.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.100
So for,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.433
math this year,
with a new holistic curriculum,

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:27.433
we really had to come together
as a team during p.l.c., and sit down

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:32.433
and kind of dissect what we were given
and kind of our next direction to go.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.466
That entailed a lot of working parts.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.233
And there were a lot of us,
having to divvy up jobs,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.533
and we had to kind of make a decision
on how we were going

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.533
to implement this best for our school.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.833
So in doing that,
we had, had to take a look at all of the,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.566
math achievement indicators
and really break it down.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.100
The first step was to kind of
find those goalposts.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.933
What were we really asking?

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.566
For example, in order of operations,
we had to decide how many operations

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:08.133
we were going to ask at the grade
six level versus the grade eight.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.466
And that was kind of the first starting
place before we could really start

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:20.166
to, create the materials
and figure out how we were going to,

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:24.633
keep alignment among the team,
and among the grade levels,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.933
but really try and, help
the students be as successful as possible.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.933
So once we had our goal posts
we were able to break off in teams

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:39.566
for grades six,
seven, eight, and create kind of our own,

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.500
you know, working plan for the students.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
We created the materials
which led to the common assessments.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.733
We we understood that being aligned
was really important,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.566
across the grade levels in the building.

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:56.800
So we really want to make sure
that we are covering

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
everything, I.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.566
So, Jamie, you're doing.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.300
Oh. He's gone.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
They're going to do

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.600
the tickets.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.266
Okay, I'm going to put.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.333
I'm going to take Jamie's out then.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.300
He's not going to do that.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.266
I will move to measurement that data.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.333
Yeah, we'll just have to let him know.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:22.333
You know?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.066
Like it's not.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.533
Yeah.
He was like mid working adults again.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:28.700
So, you know,
you just really prioritize the steps

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700
in that order.

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.666
So he's grade seven.

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.700
Yeah.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.400
So Jerry

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.133
he's just finishing up the task.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:42.633
So in

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:46.200
doing so we created the lessons
and we created the common assessments.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.966
And with that that really did
create the alignment necessary

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:52.966
across the grade levels
and for, for the teachers as well.

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.633
It was a lot of work,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:59.133
but it was kind of like,
a lot of our PLC time was spent on that.

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:03.133
And dedicated to creating this
going forward into next year.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.500
Kind of the heavy lifting is done,
and now we're able to go back

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.333
into those units and tweak things,
add things, maybe take things out

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.700
and rearrange things, as necessary.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.033
So by dedicating that time in PLC,

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:21.033
we were able to confidently deliver,

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:26.066
you know, similar materials
to the grade levels in the school.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:30.333
And it did make our job
a lot easier, as teachers,

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:34.500
because we were able to prepare the work
and, and deliver it,

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:37.966
you know, we were able to stay aligned
in terms of timing,

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.533
and our own map of what we decided,
you know, where

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.533
we'd like to be at this certain
we this certain month.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:50.266
And so,
all of that hard work really paid off

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600
and I think will continue to pay off
as the years go.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.266
Like tips or tricks for anyone
wanting to start this, it is a big job.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:00.966
We we kind of learn the hard way.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.233
We want to jump right in,
but we really had to take it back to,

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.833
the very basics of what was being asked.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.033
Kind of use our previous knowledge.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:14.433
If if you had experience teaching it,
we had to have the discussions

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:17.733
between grade levels
because, it just because you're teaching

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:21.766
fractions, it's kind of like, well, what's
grade seven asking versus grade six?

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:24.166
What are those outcomes
and how do they differ?

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.233
How are they alike?

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.933
We are trying to prepare the students
as best as we can to be successful.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:32.866
This year, but also prepare them
so that they're they're ready for next

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.033
year's material as well.
