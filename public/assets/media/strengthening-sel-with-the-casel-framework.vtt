00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.611
Hi, my name is Claire and I'm from River
Valley Middle School.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.883
I am a teacher and school counselor here,
and today I am here to share

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:20.887
what how we've been implementing
social emotional learning for school.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.924
At our school, what we've been following
is the castle format,

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.194
and that's really been the foundation
for what we've been using there.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.297
The way Castle, breaks it down

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:37.103
is into five different competencies
self-awareness, self-management,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:42.142
responsible decision making, relationship
skills, and social awareness.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.145
And so that is really,

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:48.181
I guess, the foundation
of social emotional learning.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.852
It's more than just, managing emotions.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.658
It's really about building and developing
life skills that students

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.661
need to succeed, not just in school,

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.897
but outside of school as well.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.031
We had,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.034
Mark Nicholson come in

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:10.703
and he
started with some professional learning

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:14.874
and helped us,
just basically build up our toolkit

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.711
with different practices and strategies
we could use in the classroom.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.948
So it was really great way to sort of,

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.519
sort of a refresh for us to be able
to see what we were already doing

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.689
around social emotional learning
and then act to add to it.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.893
So from there, teachers started sharing

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.764
the strategies that they were using
during our weekly PLCs

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:42.035
and their names were put in
for a weekly draw, which was fun,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.372
and they started modeling
what they were doing at our,

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:50.210
staff meetings, which has been awesome
because then we're not just hearing

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.047
about them, but we're actually participating in it, which makes a big difference.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:55.448
So, yeah,

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.451
so some of
the things that teachers have been doing

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.921
have been, like the welcoming greeting,

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.158
the way that they meet the students
before class.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.926
And it's neat to see the way teachers

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:11.498
can use their own personalities
and their own teaching styles.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.567
And I guess even their subject area
would sort

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.704
of make each strategy
a little bit unique for them.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:18.838
So, yeah.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:22.408
So we have some teachers meeting students
at the door with like a fist

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.411
pump or a high five, which is really fun.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:30.250
And then teachers are doing things,
like during class, like spring breaks,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.455
sort of to help get them engaged and move
around, give their brain a little, rest.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:39.259
So that might look like,
for some teachers, that sort of,

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.362
mindfulness practices yoga.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.032
And then we have teachers
who love to just dance,

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:49.569
so they'll put a song up on the,
on the smartboard.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.304
And the students enjoy that.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:53.373
Yeah.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:57.110
So another I
guess another example would be exit slips

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.248
and how students can sort of reflect
on what they've been learning that day

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:07.420
or in that class, but also, you know,
what they might be looking forward to.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.090
So, you know, what is one thing
that you're looking forward to

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:14.694
at the end of this week
or at the end of today?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:18.498
And just sort of just sort of to help
kind of give an optimistic

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.267
closing of the, of the lesson.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:26.739
So those are some ideas that we've been
sharing, I guess, that have been shared.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.810
As a school counselor, I think it's
really, you know, it's awesome

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.081
that we're focusing on it and really
making it, a goal for the year.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.352
And I think it's been great
bringing us together, like having us share

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:43.723
the activities that we're using,
especially like to be able to see,

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.859
like I said, different personalities
and different teaching styles.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.061
That's been fun.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.664
There's been, competition as well,
a friendly competition,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.501
to help teachers
sort of encourage teachers

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.372
to know the names
of all of the students in the building

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:02.542
and to be able to say
hi and greet them by their name.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.177
So that's been a lot of fun.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:07.580
And I absolutely can see

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.050
how it's had a positive impact
on the students when, you know,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.821
they just light up a different way
when you greet them by name.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:20.393
If you were looking to grow
like a cell in your school, I would say

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:26.032
I would encourage you to use the Castle
framework as your foundation.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.369
I mean, the Castle
framework has its own website

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:34.607
and examples of different strategies
that you can use, in your classroom.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.376
So it's a really good resource.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.379
And provides

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.448
professional learning opportunities
for the teachers.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.351
And then I would say to provide,

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:48.354
space for them to be able to share

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.658
and celebrate their,
you know, their efforts.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.593
I think that those would be

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.530
the three main
things that I would encourage you to do.
