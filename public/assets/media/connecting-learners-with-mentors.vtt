00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.810
Hi, my name is Marie Reinsborough-Wadden,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.813
and I'm the school counselor here
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.982
Today I'd like to share with you
an example

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.452
of sustaining to embed school
community relationship building

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.722
as a hallmark of the school's culture
and mission.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.624
Specifically, I'd like to talk about

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.627
our wonderful mentorship program
that we have established.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.464
Again, we're really fortunate
because Sackville is

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.567
right beside Mount Allison University,
so there's a natural partnership there.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.670
We have many programs that involve Miles
and professors and students.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.373
We're very,
very grateful for that connection.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.376
So this program
specifically started a few years ago

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.547
when we had one of our students who
I would lovingly use the term misfit with.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.550
They just couldn't
find their place to belong and connect.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.553
They just couldn't
find their people at Mercer.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.525
So we had a brilliant idea to connect them
with a man, Allison's football player.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.861
And so it was just a natural,
instant relationship.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.964
And so we saw attendance really went up.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.768
The student was attending more at school,
being more present, being more involved,

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.070
and would even like

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.007
actively celebrate
that they had made this connection.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.877
So then we started to dream about what
that could look like on a more macro

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.580
scale, not just with this one
individual relationship.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.384
So we started off the program
where we pair our students and we

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.488
we look for students
who may be similar to that initial spark,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.292
who maybe haven't found their space
like that connection belonging

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.295
piece is not the way
that we would hope for them.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.932
And one way that I do that is
I do like a grade five interview survey.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.469
So as our students first enter the school,
I spend time with each one of them,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.540
which takes a lot of my time, but it's
the most worthwhile, beneficial process.

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.943
So I get to know them
and I get to learn all about them.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.577
And I one of

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.713
the questions that I asked them
is, is there like a trusted adult

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.983
in your life that you feel a connection
with at home or at school?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:01.154
And oftentimes not oftentimes
most of the time we're good to go,

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:05.024
but sometimes I'll have students
who just cannot think of an example

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.192
of a connection that they have.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:10.029
And from a school counselor piece,
we know that long term mental health

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.698
really is

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.535
benefited by having those connections
in early years with strong, healthy adults

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.704
that don't have to be
from your family, right?

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.773
So knowing that
and having those grade five interviews

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:24.544
and seeing the success of that first try,
we decided to grow the program.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.813
And so now we have several students.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.082
I think our numbers were about 30
this year

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.817
who are paired with mentors and students.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.820
So our Mounties come in,
our mentors come in once a week

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.223
and they get to just be celebrities
in our building.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.860
So they walk in the halls
and everyone basically cheers to see them.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:44.998
It's a chance for our students to hang out
so we don't put curricular

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.065
expectations on them.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.002
We don't have them.
You know, it's not punitive.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.470
There's no expectations.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.071
It's really just about spending time

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.774
with like a trusted adult
that you feel comfortable with.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.042
And it is amazing.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.846
And so we've seen spikes in attendance
based on this as well too.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.183
So our students
who sometimes struggle to come sometimes

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.854
will only come that day when so which
I think is indicative of a great program.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:13.860
So yeah, it's been really wonderful
if I think of like tips or, or reflections

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.363
or ways to kind of what I dream
for this program, I'd love to expand it.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.065
I think it's so worthwhile.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.936
Again, it's a lot of work in the get
go to set up the process in the system,

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.105
but now kind of runs itself and the piece.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.840
So there's so many pieces
that I want to celebrate.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.309
But one part that I really think

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.346
is valuable and really important to note
is that there's not any stigma around it.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:37.116
So we know why we're choosing
certain students of our middle school.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.885
But the students don't see that part.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.588
They they have friends who are asking,
why can't I be a part of it?

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.388
Can I get in next year?

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.256
How do I sign up for this?

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:44.924
Right,
so we have a little bit of an informal

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:48.228
waitlist of students
who want to be part of this program,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.464
which I think is indicative
that it's working really well, too.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:51.831
Yeah.
