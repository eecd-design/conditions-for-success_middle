00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.142
Hi. I'm

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.145
Lucy, and I'm the guidance counselor here
at Port

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.982
Elgin Regional School at the lovely Port
Elgin School.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.985
I should say, and today,
I'm here to talk to you

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:22.055
about, classroom circles

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:26.259
and how that fosters positive relationship
building within our school.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.596
So how this practice came about

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:34.401
was I, when I came into guidance,
my role as guidance last year,

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:39.205
the principal, admin approached me
and said, can you go into each class

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.575
for half an hour a week
at a specific schedule time

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.079
and talk about and do a classroom circle?

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.283
So, for example, like grade four,
I go in every Tuesday afternoon

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.217
at the very end of the day.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.187
So kids know this is a circle time.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.789
This is the time. This one's coming in.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.959
That helps to build,

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.031
positive relationships in our building
because, all adults in

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.234
the room are also invited to participate
in the circle when I come in.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:14.207
So, teachers ease anyone any other adult
that's in in the room

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.445
is always invited to participate,
and they get to share their answers, too,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:23.216
so students can get to know them and
what they like and how they're thinking.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.984
And things like that.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.987
And I use questions
like even simple questions

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:32.025
like, would you rather questions
which can be answered, answered,

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:36.296
and kids get to know stuff that way,
or even other kids in the room.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.434
And yeah, so some tips and tricks.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.737
I start the year
like we get into deeper questions

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.974
in class,
some circles like as the year goes on.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.644
But I always start like the first, like September, like those first few weeks, just

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.379
no pressure.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.716
Questions. Like simple questions.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.919
Would you rather questions?

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.621
Like, what's your favorite questions?

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.991
Like your favorite color
or your favorite movie or your favorite?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.029
Oh, know you feel anything
can be anything.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.333
Before
you move on to the deeper questions,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.270
but that that first time, like that
first bit where you're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.806
just getting to know each other,
like really connection.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.910
But you might not know someone else
in your class like Minecraft or whatever.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.180
And then you can can connect on that,
like, oh, I played Minecraft too.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.517
And and I'll explicitly say that before

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:34.053
the circle starts, like, oh, I have some
what's your favorite questions?

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:38.258
And maybe you might find someone else in
the room, has a favorite food

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:42.128
that you also enjoy, and you can connect
on the playground later over that.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.865
Maybe it might be a kid that you haven't
really ever spoken to before.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.001
Wouldn't think to make a connection with.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.703
So I explicitly tell the kids that too.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.706
So hopefully plug
that little seed in my brain that

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:57.477
they can make those connections
if they want to.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:01.915
And for the younger years, I say it
and they all does too, but they don't.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.116
They don't really do it.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:07.554
But because like one of my circle
expectations is that only one

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:11.057
person is talking in the younger grades.

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:14.627
If someone shows like, oh,
my favorite, food is pizza,

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:18.231
a lot of the other kids like to be like,
oh, pizza is my favorite too.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.467
So to discourage that, so like,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.871
so that there's only one voice,
the person who's holding the talking piece

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.408
in the circle, we have a little like,
oh yeah, me too kind of thing.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.876
So they don't have to say it.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.179
They can just do a little hand signal
and and everyone else

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.350
the students love, love, love hearing

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.954
what the teachers get to say,
especially the would you rather questions.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.957
They really just like, oh, you know, like,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.093
oh, I won't say those, but like, oh, Mr.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:47.994
Bob, he's coming.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.263
He's coming
up. Like, what's he going to say?

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.166
I like they really, really crave

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.636
that wanting to get to know
like what the teacher is going to say.

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.404
And you have to share everything too
personal.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.808
Like we don't expect the kids
to share extremely personal things

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:06.512
from their lives, but it's nice
when the teachers model that vulnerability

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:11.451
and it kind of helps the students see,
oh, like, my teacher's a human too.
