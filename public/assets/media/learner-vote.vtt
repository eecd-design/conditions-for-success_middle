WEBVTT

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.243
So my name is Ryan Slashinsky.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.646
I'm a teacher here at Marshview
Middle School in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.617
And I have been here for the past
eight years.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:23.156
I've been teaching mostly music, but,
a smattering of other subjects as well.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.157
I've taught everything.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.160
I have a grade six homeroom, right
now, currently.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.795
And I'm Matthew Flanagan.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm a new teacher here at Marshview
Middle School.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.967
I teach social studies and science,
and, yeah,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.003
I had the pleasure of working alongside
Ryan and getting this off the ground.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:41.041
And for me at least,
and seeing the results has been fantastic.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.046
So the project that we're talking about
today is, the,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.816
student vote, which is run
by an organization called civics.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.187
It's a Canadian organization
that has been doing this for, many years.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:57.357
Every time there's an election,
provincial, federal, municipal,

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.894
they come in,
and they give us all the materials

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.464
that is needed to run a parallel election
with our students.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.401
At the same time
as the real life election is happening.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:12.272
So we get to hear what the students
have to say about the issues

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.740
facing the country today.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.044
So in this school where it's stuff
like for me, what I've noticed

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.581
is that students at this age tend
to have a very strong sense of justice.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.617
They see things in the world,
and they want to be agents for change.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.886
They want to be able to make the world
a better place.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.390
But they tend to think very globally
or even internationally.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.860
And what student votes allowed them to do
is center that on the community

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.262
and realize that the community
that they're part of,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.065
whether it's Sackville,
whether it's the Monkton community,

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.534
the Amherst community, whatever community
you're part of.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.704
There are people here
that are engaging in these issues

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.006
who are trying to make the world
a better place.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.875
And I think
that's very empowering for them,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.744
because they can realize
that they can be agents for change

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:55.181
here in the local community
without having to reach beyond

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.651
into this big,
very murky international world

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.954
that they may not be ready
to engage with yet.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.221
Yeah.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.522
One of the things I love most

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:06.392
about middle
school is how hungry the students are to,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.695
try to figure out who

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.165
they are and what they're places
in the community in the world.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:17.837
And, programs like this,
allow them to engage in, in real life.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.072
And that's what they want.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.007
They want to do real life things.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.910
They want to be a part of the real world
out there.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.344
Right?

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.714
And so we can bring that to them
in the school,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:31.518
through programs like this, we've had
we've put them in touch with their

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.355
local candidates running in the elections,
through projects like this.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.758
They get to ask questions,
they get to think about the issues.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.794
They get to formulate their own opinions
and then we ask them

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.097
to think more critically
and more deeply about them.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.935
So they're moving from,
you know, the simple slogans, to,

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:54.774
actually, you know, you know,
some thoughtful, debate and dialog

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.944
with each other and with their teachers
and with their community.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:02.182
And we get a chance, I think, to explore
the metacognition side of the curriculum,

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.885
where they're able now to think about
not only what I believe to be true

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.355
or what I believe to be right, or wrong,
and why I believe that.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.892
And I think there's a good transfer
of skill opportunity there to learn.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:16.062
Not only is it
practical in the political sense, it's

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.232
practical in an employment sense
and a personal development sense

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.168
where you're making choices
and you're now able to stop and say,

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.469
why are these choices?

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.005
Why this perspective, why this bias?

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.642
And we have an opportunity to dig in
and really get them to explore

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.879
how they came to be, who they are today,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.516
and what choices they can make to be
who they want to become in the future.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.652
And there's a sort of deliberate side
to this curriculum,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:43.323
I think, to this, this activity
that really challenges them

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.692
to think about who they are
and why they are who they are.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.428
Also, importantly, it's fun.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.262
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.163
The key features

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.433
of, working with middle schoolers
is that it's always got to be fun.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.169
And they truly enjoy.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:01.874
Most of them will enjoy working
on, these, these projects,

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.712
or even volunteering to be part
of the actual procedures themselves.

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:06.646
Right.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:09.048
There's always a list,
a long list of people

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.084
who are willing to take some time
out of the day

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.487
to, make sure that the procedures
are being followed, right.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.089
To make sure that, yeah,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.424
it starts with them saying, yeah,
we're going to get out of class. Yeah.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.760
Okay. Yeah. And then, oh,
this is a lot of work.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.929
And then, oh,
this is really interesting actually.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.398
And then seeing the
why it's done that way as well.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:25.665
Right.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.668
That these are not just rituals
that we go through.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:29.135
Right.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:32.205
It is not just you show up
and you stand in line and it's there's

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.208
there's real reasons
why we do these procedures.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.378
There's real reasons
why we have the, the steps that we take.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.647
And then they can see that
as they're doing it.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.682
And oh, okay,
these are in place for a reason.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:44.684
Elections work like this for a reason.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.153
And they can go on
and see that I think in a better way. And.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.324
It requires a lot of collaboration.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.093
There's a lot going on behind the scenes
before the kids

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.995
actually even start engaging with it. Yet.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:59.165
So yeah, having,
having good collegial, sports

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:02.201
like, we can get Matt
and I are side by side in that room.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:06.039
So finding those five seconds
in between classes to figure out

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.442
what we're doing, is really crucial
to make things happen. Yes.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.110
And I think the other side of that, too,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.545
is something
we've been kind of talking about

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.947
is that they
they come to us with their opinions

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.417
and their beliefs
and their perspectives on the world.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:21.754
And it's not for us to try
to impose a more sophisticated

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:24.791
or more adult or a more developed
give them the space

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.994
to articulate what those opinions are,
what those beliefs are.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.263
And and they're not silly
and they're not trivial.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.567
They're what they come equipped with
and with a lot of the projects

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:38.071
and a lot of the steps in these projects,
we can then take those and help them

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.074
develop those perspectives
with a little bit more solid grounding,

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.976
so that they can feel a bit
more confident, discard

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.712
the ones that they maybe
don't believe anymore

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.614
because they've had the opportunity
to challenge themselves

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.050
and then get a little bit
more sophisticated as we go through

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.554
so that there's a more intention
and deliberation and what they believe.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.322
But it's always important to remember that

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.758
they don't come here with a blank tabula
rasa.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.026
There's no blank slate.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.930
They come into your class with beliefs,
and they're not trivial to them,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.666
even if they sound maybe silly
to the adult world.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:06.966
Right?

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.069
And we have a chance to cultivate them
and help them grow that themselves.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.539
And there's a lot of steps,
I think, in that process, in these,

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:17.009
projects that they work
on, it kind of really they look silly

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.544
sometimes
when you're doing them in the moment,

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.447
but then you realize that, no,
this is planting a firmer soil

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:24.450
or a richer soil for them
to grow those opinions with, I think.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.084
Yeah.
