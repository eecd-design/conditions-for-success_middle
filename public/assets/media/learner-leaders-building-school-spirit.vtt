00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.743
My name is Stephanie MacKenney.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:15.382
I am the primary PhysEd teacher and
athletic director at River Valley School.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:20.887
The relationship that I am
primarily involved in is student leaders.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:25.859
We meet Mondays during our Richmond block,
which happens at the end of the day,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.530
and we have about 50 students,
50, 55 students

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:36.369
who, come weekly
and we hang out in hours.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:41.875
And then which is just next door,
and we talk about things that we can do to

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.945
pump up the school
and get involved in the school

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.949
and interact with the classrooms
and the home rooms

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.189
and the different kids
that, don't always get to be on.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:00.026
The sports teams are don't always get to
go on the field trips and stuff like that.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.563
So, the student leaders are the kids

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.833
who really, really embody
the spirit of the school.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.837
If you were looking to run
a student leader program at your school.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.074
What we've done, with our student body

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.343
is we offered the opportunity
to everybody.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:21.014
So with grade six, grade seven and eight,
everybody, it has a fair chance

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.317
of coming in
and being a part of student leaders.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.687
You fill out a questionnaire so that we do
know a little bit of your interests

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:31.724
and where to possibly put you
if there is an opportunity that comes up.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.396
So our questionnaire is, open again
at the beginning of the year.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.233
We have that information. If

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.203
it turns into a little

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.940
bit more of,
I want to get out of school kind of thing,

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.510
then we have a very honest conversation
with the student.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.914
But, majority again, of our kids
really do want to be there.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:59.452
We have had bigger groups in the past
and smaller groups as well.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.754
It just really depends on the year.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.225
With having the application

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:09.229
form, it also allows us to gauge
the interests of the students.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.466
So say you were really keen
on helping out in the environment.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.137
We do have a recycling team
through student leaders

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.907
that goes out into the school and collects
the recycling from the classrooms.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.513
If you were really keen on volunteering
in the community, we have opportunities.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:29.215
Within student leaders
to volunteer in the community.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:34.254
We've worked
with, volunteering at the groups

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.257
that come into the school with the PSC.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:41.094
So if there's a movie night,
we have students that come in and work

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:45.398
the door or work the admission or,
another opportunity

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.868
for something like that would be
we have, our drama production.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:54.107
The kids would sell the tickets, and,
they would also collect the tickets.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.311
If the students wanted
to stay in the school but still help out

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.948
with the school, at the end of the year,
we have the grade fives come in.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:02.315
Right.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:06.152
So the our student leaders are touring
our grade fives this week.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:10.990
We do a Pump It Up Friday
where we have bubbles and chalk and music.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.992
And just recently we did face paint.

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.460
So all the student leaders

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.529
were here bright and early,
and they set up the tables

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.933
and stuff like that
to help us get all that in order.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.068
So before they even came
into the building,

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.002
when they came off the bus,

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:26.739
they got hyped up and they did
all the really, really fun stuff.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:31.044
We've done school dances
where they are in charge of school dances.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:37.217
So really, Student Leaders offers that
opportunity to just really get involved

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.421
and diversify your interest based on a
whole bunch of different things.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:47.393
So whatever works for your school,
you could totally run with with the kids.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.728
What ends up happening?

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.931
You have a sense of camaraderie,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.934
that, hey,
I get to be the person to do this,

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.505
or for somebody
who wouldn't necessarily be

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.108
the person to be, oh, I want to do it.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.576
I want to do it. I want to do it.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:08.781
It allows them to be maybe with a friend
or by themselves, to still be a part

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.517
and be involved, but maybe a little bit
more behind the scenes

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.253
if they don't want to be
that front runner.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.023
It allows the students to,

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:21.027
be all together in one spot
because again, we meet weekly,

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:24.697
we meet on again,
like I mentioned earlier, Mondays.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.734
So it is one of those things
where we also take

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.203
attendance,
where we hold the students accountable.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:34.340
It allows them to really gel
over the period of a year

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.809
because of that consistency factor.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.811
Everybody knows everybody's name.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.814
Everybody has a chance to jump
into something different.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:46.085
And you really do see that pride

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.155
comes through by the end of the year,
because they do get to be involved.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:52.058
They do get to be a little bit more

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.294
out there.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:54.594
Right.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:58.164
So it is, again, lots of fun, really good
energy, really good vibe.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.565
Leaders is awesome.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:04.003
I would say any school
should try in some capacity to do it.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:09.208
Other schools might have, and saac
or student administrative council,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.779
whatever you end up calling it,
but it really empowers the kids.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.515
It really gives them a chance to step up.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:19.452
It offers an opportunity to really see
that other side of the student,

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.187
which is really, really cool.

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:24.057
Again, you sometimes

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:28.027
have your standouts, but it's
those those kids that do end up just

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:33.032
it sounds corny, but blooming
or blossoming and really, really

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.601
coming into their own.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:39.372
Especially if you have students
that have done it their whole middle

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.275
school career, going from grade
six, grade seven, grade eight.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.678
There's a sense of ownership
that really kind of carries through.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:49.549
So I would challenge
anybody to even even start small

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:55.054
or maybe even pick a specific event
and really just build on that.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.690
So I've really enjoyed being a part of it.
