00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:09.676
Hi there.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.480
My name is Dolores Borthwick
and I am a mentoring coordinator

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.083
for Big Brothers
Big Sisters here in Charlotte County.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.487
With an office right here
at Fundy Middle and High School.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.423
We have a very unique program
here at Fundy

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.559
because we are a middle school
and a high school together.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.363
I love that, yes,
it's teenagers from this school right here

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:34.367
that are matched with middle level kids
when they're identified.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.705
We've had a few that have traveled
to elementary schools over the years

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.775
and then get to be with their mentee
the next year

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.443
when they come here in grade six.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.978
It's it's beautiful.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.613
It's a really beautiful thing.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:50.150
And to see the grade six kids,
the middle level kids, when they come here

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.453
knowing that they have someone
that they can identify with

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.323
when they come into their new school, is
is it truly a beautiful thing for them?

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:02.095
You can see that they're more relaxed
here, that they they some of our mentees

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.998
this year have been able
to get involved in sports

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.334
and just be all around more comfortable
here at the school,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.438
knowing they have someone
older here to look up to.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.274
So with our in-school

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:18.411
mentoring program, we start recruiting
kids at the beginning of the school year.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.579
They come to me.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.514
There is an application process.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.451
There is an interview process
as well as a training process.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.585
Because we have Big brothers.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.788
Big Sisters do everything we can
to make sure the people

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:32.258
that spend time with
our clients are safe to be with.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.294
And so we do this process.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.297
Really great process for the teenagers.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.033
Most of them have not done
a lot of interviews or

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.202
and they're just getting their own resume
ready.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:46.339
So this is very cool for them to be able
to add to their resume as,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.876
as something that they've done
and volunteer work of course.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:55.248
And again, they're matched for one hour
once a week together for the school year.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:59.085
We have a mentoring room downstairs

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.889
with a huge amount of activities
for them to do together.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.892
Whether they play board games together,
they paint together.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.229
They,
they make all kinds of things together.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.030
We also do group programs.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.134
We do go girls for girls, game on
for boys.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:18.304
That focus on healthy living,
being active

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.941
and and healthy
eating and love those programs as well.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:27.347
We are in process of go girls rate
at the moment weekly six week programs.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.182
We love our program here.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:33.486
Over the last several years we've grown,
especially with the teen mentoring

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:38.458
from a few years back of doing
maybe like 12 matches to this year.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.961
We have 36
teen in school mentoring matches.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:46.533
That includes matches here at Fun Day,
as well as some teens that travel

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:50.503
to our three feeder
elementary schools here in our area.
