00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.843
My name is Caitlyn.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.879
I am the behavior intervention mentor
at Doctor Lucy Middle School.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.316
And I'm going to talk about night mode
extra care today.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.221
Night mode is a communication
that we send out to all staff,

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.324
and it is to inform them
that one of their students might need

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.327
a little extra care
or a little extra support.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:32.032
This started when I had a student
come in first thing in the morning,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.001
middle of the week,
and told me about a traumatic thing

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.203
that had happened
the evening before at home,

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.707
and they were at school that morning
just feeling off.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.108
And I was thinking, man,

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.676
when he went back to class,
I was thinking, man,

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.446
I wish I could go
and tell all of his teachers

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.381
just to give them
a little bit of grace today.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.684
So I did go to some teachers and

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.921
let them know, hey, can you just give them
a little extra care today?

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.123
And of course, they were like,
what happened?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.993
Like, they're very
they all care about their students here.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:04.064
And it was time consuming and
I really wanted to keep it confidential.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.132
So like I said, just give them extra care.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.035
So we are the doctor closing nights.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.470
So we kept with the brand.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.739
That's called night Mode Extra Care.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.342
It is an email that goes out
as needed to all staff,

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:20.947
and it says night mode in the,
in the subject line.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.382
And then it says New Tonight mode,

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.152
and we'll put a name, just the name,
no description of what's going on.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.190
And, and then it says kids
who are still in night mode

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.860
and will have a list of kids who maybe
lost one out, like the week before.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.396
And they're still
they still need that extra care.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.466
So all that the, code

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.469
means is
this kid needs some extra care right now.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.505
Sometimes that means
they extend some deadlines

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.508
or they don't expect them to participate
as much in class.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.312
Or if they see them a little down,
they just kind of give them a little bit

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.347
of a break. Yeah.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.283
And I've gotten really good feedback
from it. Hi,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:01.654
my name is Greg Keating
and I am a classroom teacher here at Dr.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.591
Losier. I teach math and science.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:09.696
And I am going to speak
specifically about our night mode

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.366
that we have developed here at Doctor
Losier

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:18.638
In cooperation with our behavior
intervention mentor, Caitlyn Napke.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.841
And this program I'm

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.845
going to speak to as a classroom teacher
and how it supports us

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:29.382
as classroom teachers
and ultimately supports our students,

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.952
from a classroom perspective.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.622
I enjoy that.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:40.059
I'm kept in the role of students
that might be experiencing challenges,

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:45.064
and night mode does let us know
we get a weekly email through night mode

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.134
that allows us to know, okay,

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.137
this week
these students are still in night mode.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.672
Or maybe there's a student

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.242
that's been added to night mode
because they're experiencing a challenge

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.946
and it lets us know as teachers, okay,
how can we best support this student?

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.782
Maybe they'll need breaks
from the classroom.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:07.053
Maybe they'll need some time
in our nightstand to do their work.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:12.625
Maybe they'll need, whatever the need
might be, it allows us as classroom

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.728
teachers to be aware of these

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.132
specific students
are experiencing challenges.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.936
How can we, as classroom teachers
support that and support

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.137
our behavior intervention?

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:30.109
Mentor support our S team as a team
working to support our students.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.814
In year
before this program existed, oftentimes,

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:38.418
frontline teachers in the classroom
might not be aware

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.621
of students in the room
that we're experiencing challenges.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.824
And this program has allowed us

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.728
to be aware of some of the needs
our students have,

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.697
some of the challenges are experiencing,

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:54.033
and how we can best support them
in a positive way within our school.
