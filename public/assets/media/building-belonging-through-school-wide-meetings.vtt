00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.876
Hi, my name is Sacha Koumbias.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.978
I'm the principal of River Valley
Middle School.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:16.349
I wanted to share with you,
a little bit about River Valley’s

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.251
school wide meetings.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.087
Each week we have a school wide meeting.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.323
It's held on teens.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.326
We do it on Wednesdays during enrichment.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.064
Our meetings are a way to build community

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.969
and to connect our students
and to give them a sense of belonging.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.440
Our school meetings
feature different features each week.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.743
So some of the favorites are,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.212
parts of River Valley

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:50.216
and, we have a little raider
that we hide around the school,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.885
the Raiders, our mascot.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.721
And so the kids try to find the Raider
all week.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.357
And then the winner is announced
during our school wide meetings.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:01.428
We draw ballots for our Raiders ballots,
and that's an incentive program.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.064
We have to reinforce good behavior.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.068
We talk about our Raider values, and,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:12.072
we'll have a little activity or a mini
lesson based on those Raider values.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.376
And we celebrate things
that the kids are doing really well.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:20.780
So if someone has won something out
in the community, we'll talk about that.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:25.852
Sometimes we feature a student
for a bus award, so the bus

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:29.522
drivers will nominate students
who've been really respectful on the bus.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:35.361
And, they'll give me their name and
we will recognize them during the meeting.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.365
At the beginning of each meeting,
we reestablish

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.368
our norms and we talk about
why we having the meeting.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:48.208
So we talk about the meeting
being, a way to connect, to

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:52.612
bring us together as a team to celebrate,
to give us things to work on.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.182
And we talk about our, our, our values.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.519
So one thing I've learned from
this project is that the meeting

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.653
brings us together.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.656
It creates unity and connection.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.160
And so we're all receiving
the same message at the same time.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.896
We're all celebrating the same things
at the same time.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.733
And we really feel that there's
like a real sense of community

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.836
since we've begun these projects
that we do together as a school.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.039
I think one thing that I have learned
is that you need to try

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.710
to make them as interactive as possible,
because they are 30 minutes long

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.813
and you don't want to just listen to me
speak for 30 minutes.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.182
So we try to make them
as interactive as possible.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:34.354
So some of the things that we do
maybe like go do this in your class,

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.490
come back in five minutes and report back
what you've done.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.094
So there's activities that
they'll do in class and then report back.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.631
So making it as interactive as possible
and getting as many voices

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.099
involved as possible.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.702
So one of the features that we do
is, a wellness tip each week.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.671
And our guidance counselor
will take care of that.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.674
So having different staff
members and students present

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.677
is, really impactful.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.814
And, I think looking forward to next
year, I would like to have

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:05.752
more student voice and more students
running the majority of our meetings.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:10.557
I think the kids are really connected
to us as an administration,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.327
because throughout the week,
as I encounter students,

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.497
they'll talk to me about things
that have happened or have been said

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.132
during the school wide meeting.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.101
And I think that the kids
really see what we value

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.037
because we value it
enough to talk about it.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.672
During the school wide meeting.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.775
And so when I say something
about being grateful

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.078
because that was one of our our values,

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.482
they'll make little comments to me during
the week, like all I was grateful for.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.617
And I can see that

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:42.155
there was impact because I could see that
it was important to me and to the staff.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.158
And I think that that's a nice
little connection to have with the kids.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.327
I start as an administrator.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:52.832
It was a great way for me to really embed
certain things into our culture.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:59.038
So I have the opportunity to model
the values each week.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.709
So as an example,
this month has been a responsibility.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.645
That's our our our value.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:10.450
And I am able to organize activities
for the classes about responsibility.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.952
And so it's a good way for me
to be an instructional leader

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:17.156
as well on the building
and to value and to, model

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.493
some of those good practices as well,
just not just for our students,

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.361
but for our staff.
