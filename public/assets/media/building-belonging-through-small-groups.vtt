00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.576
I'm Mandy Chambers.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.012
I am the vice principal of Fundy Middle
and High School.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.982
Today, what I'm going to talk about is
relationship building with small groups.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.619
So at lunch time,
we had a vice principal.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.489
It seemed like I was swamped after
lunch coming in.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.992
All of the students lined up
outside of the office

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:29.529
needed to see an administrator,
because there was some kind of problem.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.699
Whether somebody called them a name,
somebody was texting,

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:37.003
something was happening in their life that
they felt like they needed adult help.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.907
So they were kind of lacking
some structure, lacking an activity

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.208
to do outside.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.678
Lacking a connection
of who to find in the building

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.814
when something, wasn't there.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:52.018
And maybe not really aware of
some social skills or how to make friends.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.922
So my solution was to make,
a group take in these students

00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:00.493
that felt like they needed,
a spark to come, join.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.997
And they were really, interested
in doing some of those activities.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.033
So they weren't really
they were drawn against by

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.735
the thought that, hey,
we're going to go outside.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:13.673
We're going to, do some fun
activities, to use up our time.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:17.544
So a couple of them were, had requested
they come in the club

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.579
and then a couple of them
I approached and was like,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.980
hey, we're meeting at lunchtime.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.482
Do you want to join this club?

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.618
Instead of looking for somewhere they fit?

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.388
Find what fits them.
So it's a little bit backwards.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.558
So like I said, you're not making a, club

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.994
that's necessarily called soccer,
called math club.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.332
You're making a club for people,
making a people club, and then you're

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:43.269
building on what it is they want,
what direction they want to go in.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.572
And sometimes
they might want to do basketball,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.540
but sometimes they might want to do
something else.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.844
See, be flexible, offer
a variety of different activities.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.412
It doesn't just have to be one,

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.282
but really what you're doing is you're
meeting their needs and their feelings.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.184
And we're not going to call it
a feelings club,

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.154
but really we're trying
to make that connection with them

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.858
through whatever activity
that that the group needs at that time.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.961
They know that they
they can come to the club

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.865
and that's when they're going to get
be greeted with a positive adult.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.933
They're going to it's a spot for them.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.737
They can feel safe, they can have fun,
they can be themselves at school.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.939
There's something
they can look forward to.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.609
It has impacted the students,

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.677
just the fact
that they have a positive relationship.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.680
So sometimes they'll come in and
they're having a hard day or struggling,

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.251
they're refusing adults or not
quite doing what they're supposed to do.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.022
When I get called up, someone knows
I've made that relationship with them,

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.057
so they'll ask me to come up and assist.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.261
And as soon as they see me, you can tell
that they're even their demeanor changed.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.563
They're a little bit more open
to a conversation

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.366
and more willing to engage
in what they're supposed to be doing.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.737
So, it has been important for them,
for me, my personally,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.407
what I really like is the relationship
I've built with them.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:57.076
So whether I see them in the hallway,
they're saying,

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.445
good morning, Miss Chambers,
or they're coming to give me a hug

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.649
if I see them in the community,
they're always happy to see me.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.684
So it's been very positive for me.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.520
The day that we do
the club is one of my more exciting days.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.055
I look forward to it.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.091
Sometimes I get into the woods
or just have a conversation with them.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.862
So it's been a great
relationship building piece.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.498
I feel that every

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.268
student has a place and belongs
and needs that adult connection.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.105
And just to know that you can make
a difference for students,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.108
and you can be that one person
that makes their day

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:32.245
better, that makes their whole
high school, middle school career better.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.415
So it's our job as educators
to make them feel welcomed.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.550
We can make them find their place.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.318
They need that.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.154
And that's what we're here
for. And it's rewarding work.
