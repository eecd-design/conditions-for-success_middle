00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.743
My name is Cameron Rudderham.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.777
I'm at Fundy High School.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.013
I'm an academic sport teacher.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.450
I guess we're talking about,
data driven teaching.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.287
So we make sure that when we're responding
to our students who are responding

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:25.091
to their actual scores
on different types of curricular tests,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:29.129
as opposed to just basing it on the fact
that they're in a great ed classroom

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.165
from the beginning,
where we're doing a series of screeners

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.234
so that we can get through
large numbers of people,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:38.304
and using these screeners to decide
if we need follow up testing,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.307
whether it be numeracy
or whether it's a literacy class.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.478
And then we do in-depth testing
with the people that we need to follow up.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.814
If they don't do well on the screeners.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.415
So we're

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.684
kind of reducing the number of people
that we have to deal with on each tier

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:57.323
until we can isolate the ones that need
different types of, of work with people.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.293
Some might need curricular adjustment,
some might just need,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.964
support in classroom situations,
which is mostly probably what I do once

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.266
a year gets going.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.636
And then as the year goes
on, the support will change depending on

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.438
the results from our data,

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:13.673
we try to write

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.643
our assessments that we're going to use.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.914
Write them as a group each year for our
our major units.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.517
If we if we agree that each unit
will have to

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.554
sort of formal assessments for a strand,
whether it be

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.390
for, let's say for, for writing or for

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.426
reading response to reading,
then we might make sure that we,

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:37.430
we use two stories for each grade level
that we're going to use for that unit.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.567
And then each year,
even though we might have

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.304
some that we've saved that we try to read,
we write the questions

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.907
to make sure that we're kind of appealing
to the level of the kids that we have.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.776
So when we start out
with our reading screeners,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.378
we usually sort of start with

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:56.316
concrete, you know, more literal questions
and then kind of work our way up.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:02:00.086
And we we try to make sure that each,

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.890
each unit, we have at least a beginning,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.860
kind of like a pretest for that outcome.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.129
And then we have one at the end
that we've all agreed upon,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.266
so that in between there, people will
often work together to choose stories.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.470
But in the beginning, we at least
make sure our pretest is the same in our

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.876
our sort of summative final test
for that information is the same.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.312
So we know at least we're we're dealing
with the same learning outcomes.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.917
And that's our goal that in that time
we often will regroup for.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.152
That's when support comes in.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:37.557
If we look at a a group and they have 7
or 8 twos, I think last year

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:42.162
our goal was to reduce the number of twos
by 25% across the board.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.065
And you know, Durham during a month or so,
we were able

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:50.703
to reduce most classes
at least 25% just by all being,

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.972
diligent about making

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:57.310
sure we're asking for the exact same
information stated in the same way,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.182
so that we have a clear kind of response
format that we use for what we

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.019
what we accept,
and we try to make sure that we look

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.355
look at a couple examples
from each class to,

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.992
to ensure that we're all going
to respond to them in the same way

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:16.996
and apply the same point structure to them
so that, you know, you're in

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.765
some of these class, it shouldn't,

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.800
shouldn't be completely different
than someone else's.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.303
There's personalities that come out,

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.272
but we need to be addressing
the same curriculum outcomes.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.877
Never assume that people can do the things
that we know

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.212
they're supposed to be able to do

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.681
because,

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:38.384
not knowing the multiplication or not
knowing addition facts is debilitating.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.788
And so you see that some people will
guess, some people will pretend

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.791
to be mad about other things
and have behavior issues,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.428
and some people will just ignore
and pretend like I'm not there.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.698
So sometimes it looks like behavior
and sometimes it's,

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:56.369
it's a remediation
that's required the end of the year.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:01.341
This year, I've spent a lot of time
with, kind of with fluency.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.675
And that's

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:05.545
I've had kids reading with me
for three weeks now

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.548
on fluency passages, specifically just to

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.286
to take their level and to practice
reading through text numerous times and,

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.991
kind of identifying speed and rate
and the pattern at which they,

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.794
you know, their cadence and most of them
have increased at least ten, 15 words

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:26.232
a minute, some of them as close to 20
or 25, an outlier before it.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.134
Most would be somewhere between

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.338
ten and 20 words a minute increase.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.642
And so I feel good about that.
