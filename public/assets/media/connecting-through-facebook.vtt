Hi. I'm Beth Weatherbee.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.647
I'm, the music, teacher here
at Port Elgin Regional School.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:19.986
I also do some fizz ed and,
I call myself the PR specialist

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:20.687
here of the school.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.690
I think that's probably very small letters
everywhere.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.660
And I am in charge of the Facebook pages,

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:33.099
and I also get a lot of information out
first, with a, class dojo.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.138
So,
I started a long time ago that we started

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.708
putting information up on Facebook
about the school,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.712
and really, it's used a lot now,
a lot of people are using it,

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.515
and a lot of people are sending stuff
to, to share.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.184
So it's been helpful that way.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.120
Looks like a lot of information going out

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.157
so they can see what visitors we have
at the school.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.360
We they can see
who's made donations to the school.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.596
In our community, they can see, students

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.666
that have won tournaments
or dance competitions,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.503
they can see teachers who have won awards
in the last couple weeks.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.672
So it's it's a lot of good news stuff.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.809
It's also maybe making people aware

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.813
of, trying to stay down at 15km
when they're coming in the yard

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:23.583
so that we don't have any accidents,
and just getting the information

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.619
out there about what's
going on in our school, in our community.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:28.988
Dojo is a closed

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.991
site, so only parents are on that one.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.463
Facebook page is anybody
who wants to order over 1000, followers.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.799
So that would be grandparents
and other family members.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.869
And I know we have some, former Mariners
who who,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.872
like to follow and follow our page.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.476
And, so it tends to be just community

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:54.581
members, retired teachers, students
that used to go here,

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.384
and parents,
you know, of kids that used to go here.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.186
So, yeah. right.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:05.658
And so we're really aware
that we may have parents that don't read.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:09.362
So sending out newsletters is great,
but it doesn't really help

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.530
if they are not able to read.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.367
So, we can use our video technology
that we have here

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:19.339
and students can can read the, the notices
and, and they get the opportunity

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.942
to get some presentation skills and,
we get to share them.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.714
And that goes both on Facebook
and on dojo.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.518
Just might be a lice notification
or sleeping tips

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.654
or tips to help with anxiety
and things like that.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.755
So. Oh,

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.859
I think my biggest takeaway is that,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.495
the more information
that we get out there, the more

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:46.132
communicating we do, the more that we see
that there's great things happening here.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.569
And people kind of feel real positive
about what's

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.672
going on at our school,
knowing that we've got a green house here.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.442
And the link is here
and, the health center

00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:00.280
and libraries, we've got a lot of things
in this kind of hub area,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.451
and I feel like we're,
kind of a positive area because of that.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.788
for tips, I think.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.023
Get your media release forms.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.124
So you're the person

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:15.195
who's posting stuff, just has a list
and it just can go directly through that.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:19.265
And then have communications
going on within the staff.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.700
What do they want to see on there?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.770
And they then it becomes the point
where a lot of the staff

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.773
just share it right to me and say, hey,
please post this and post this.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.276
So we have a lot of our wins,
getting posted up there

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.580
and a lot of our,
things that we're grateful for.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.414
So yeah.
