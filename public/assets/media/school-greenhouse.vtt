Hello, my name is Christoph Becker.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.946
I'm the principal of Port Elgin
Regional School, and I'd like to talk to

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.081
you folks for a little project
that we've done at our school.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:19.152
It's a greenhouse,
and it grew out of the necessity of food

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.155
in our community
because we're a low socioeconomic area.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.959
So we built this incredible greenhouse,
which most people see in.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.093
It's an industrial greenhouse.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.530
It's not a small endeavor,
but it turned into something

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.533
much more than just a means
of getting food for our children.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.804
And it created, a means of
doing a project based learning block.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:38.805
And out of that,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.209
we created a unit called sustainability,
where we now have food in the greenhouse,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:48.181
we have bees, we have a solar array
and, food force and our school

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.751
and composting all that stuff
so the children could learn and use it.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.253
An incredible vessel.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.589
But beyond that, the greenhouse
now produces food for our children.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.592
In the cafeteria,
we go around with a salad bar.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:04.664
Once the lettuce is growing at peak
season, usually end of February till June.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.701
And we see that serving salad
and it reduces the cost in the cafeteria.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.704
This lettuce also goes to a local charity

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.707
who feeds about 38 of our children
a hot lunch program.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.511
So it's just a vessel of of ways
to give back.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.482
So and I this greenhouse is unique.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.519
And we made it when we looked at
how to build it, we wanted a four season

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.557
greenhouse because the children
are in school from September till June,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.327
and most greenhouses only grow up
to about October, maybe end of November.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:38.098
This one will go to the end of December
because it has a climate battery

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.033
where heat is stored underground,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.535
and then it will commence again
in the end of February,

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.107
and we can produce as much lettuces
as possible at that point.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.382
So it's become an incredible learning
tool.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.085
It's a huge endeavor to start.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.888
But when we started,
we first got that initial

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.891
grant through a food, food grant.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.826
I think it's approximately $20,000.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:10.630
And as soon as we had that, everybody in
the community started come in, we

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.467
had sponsors that would step in and clubs,
and everybody started giving money.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.568
And then it just took off.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.505
And it was easy,
to get the money to make it.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.942
So if you want something like this,
I would highly encourage it because it's

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:27.147
incredible tool for not only food security
but for teaching kids at all levels.
