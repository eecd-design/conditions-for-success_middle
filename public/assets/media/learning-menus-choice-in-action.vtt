00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.877
So my name is Melanie Doucet,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:14.547
and I work at Birchmount , school,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.718
and I teach grades
seven and eight immersion.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.889
So I'm going to talk
about the different types of,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.292
menu that I have for kids
to have choices in my class.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.896
So they have a system in place
now that it's like work of the week.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.632
I teach. It
depends on how many classes I teach in.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.702
So it could go to, like it's all week.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.572
We have the do you have the choice
to what they're going to be working on.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.043
So if I teach in science class
or social study,

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.579
they could have groups working on Sundays
and other groups working on social study

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.415
or other groups working on science.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.950
Then the of what the work I give them.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.852
It's easy way also to do cross-curricular.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.120
So I have project going on

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.689
that are both at the same time
could be French and social study.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.858
It could be social study and science,

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.694
or be working with other teachers
and completing their class in there.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:06.433
So what I do is that they have
this amount of work that they have to do,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.802
and it just has to be finished
for the end of the week.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.272
So it gives them independence,
even if it's not as much exciting,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.641
just because they can choose
which one they can do first.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.913
Often it's it gets them more on
task and going and knowing too, that

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.916
this has to be done at the end of the day,
at the end of the week.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:28.354
Makes them more accountable
also for the work and also the I will

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.892
give them like free time on the Friday
if they're all their work is done.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.895
So they also have a reward
if they're finishing

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.330
and if they're not finished, well,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.333
it's homework or it's work
that they have to under the time

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.470
on their own that they have their own me,
that they have to finish their work,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.142
they also in there have the choice
to have different projects inside of that.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.145
So example,
if they all have to do a science project

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.415
about information about,
I don't know, a career in science.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.518
They have different choices
to way to present sometimes.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.720
So they could have a writing.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.055
They could have a video.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:06.359
They could have
I want a comic scrap or different ways

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.094
to present the same information.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.596
So they also have different choices.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.898
Like that's not always the case.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:16.669
I do recommend that if you're
giving choices that you don't, do

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.739
too complicated things
so that you don't get overwhelmed

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:25.745
to have to, guide teacher
the students all the time.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.983
So example, you might give 2 or 3 things
that are more independent

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:34.587
and then one choice that might need more
hands on from you with the students.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.858
I didn't start this, like all,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.561
all or nothing kind of goal.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.096
I started a little bit at a time.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.899
I started a few years back
when I was teaching art

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.902
to a different class,
a difficult management class.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:52.105
So what I've given them was,
they had, like, eight

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:56.176
different project of art they could do
that, had the different goals they wanted,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:00.747
and they could choose, four, and
they had to have finished up in six weeks.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.449
And that really helped manage
that behavior class.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.152
That was very hard
that everybody's having trouble with.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:09.155
And I had zero behavior issue.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:13.293
So then I slowly started to put that
in all of my other classes.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:17.030
But I didn't do it like all or nothing
kind of thing.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.431
It was a little bit at a time.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.402
Maybe they had choices for some projects,
maybe they had process

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.405
for 4 or 5 weeks,
or maybe it was like a slow process.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:30.343
Now I do it all the time, like it's
like money, like 99% of the time.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.346
That's what I'm doing. But I wouldn't.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.315
You can start it slowly.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.349
You can start it for a week.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.051
You can start it for for a few of days,

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.786
maybe three days a week
or something like that.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.621
It doesn't have to be all or nothing.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.757
Also, to help out
too, is the system of organization.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.092
I find that,

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.694
you get a lot of different things

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.964
at the same time
so that what could get overwhelm I use

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:54.400
now I use team
and I use it, for everything.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.638
In a sense, it's one place assignments
and all of their assignment in this paper

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:01.641
or in anything, they have to take a photo
and put it there also.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.611
So that way I know where to look
because it can get

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.479
because they're not working
on the same thing at the same time.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.183
Who's done who's not done
something that I used to do it paper wise,

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.118
but you have to have a system of checks

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.587
and stuff like that,
and you also have to have a system

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.458
in place that they all put it
at the same spot and don't give it to you

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.527
like 5 or 10 different ways,
because then you get confused
