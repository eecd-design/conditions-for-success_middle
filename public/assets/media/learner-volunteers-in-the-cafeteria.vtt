00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.876
Hi. My name is

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.846
Christiana, and I'm a teacher
at Marshview Middle School.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.583
Today I'm going to be talking to you
about how we develop peer learning,

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:20.186
and interdependence
through our work in the cafeteria.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.724
So our students, are invited in grades
seven and eight

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.294
to participate in our cafeteria program
as a volunteer.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:33.133
This program is a free lunch program
that we have, through the support

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.702
of community members
and outside organizations

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.506
So our local food bank provides
us, with sandwiches and snacks

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.209
on a regular basis, and they respond
to the needs, in the community.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.813
So if we say, hey, this week, we,
you know, we were short on sandwiches,

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.748
they'll send us more next week.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:53.119
And if I email them and say, hey, like
this week, we actually didn't need as much

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.423
and they'll, they're mindful to cut back
so there's less food waste.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.460
And so they,
they are really great partners in that,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.496
in that they also understand
that kids need to be fed.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:08.268
And they, they acknowledge the importance
of that and are willing to support us.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.870
We also get some outside funding.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.908
There are different organizations
that, will put out calls for funding.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.444
And then we can apply for grants.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.145
And, and so we've gotten some funding

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.482
that way, which has been allowed us
to enlarge the program.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.653
where anybody can come any day at lunch
and get something to eat.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:30.156
We work through, teaching them

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.193
cooking skills and safety,
kitchen safety skills.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:36.529
And there
there's all kinds of things going on.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.433
And so we eventually prepare meals
for hot lunches on Friday.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.571
This is something that, you know,
it takes a while to, to work on.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.873
And we have we have a lot of skills
we have to develop.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.843
But our students are able to serve to cook

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.880
and to learn how to properly prepare food
that is safe for everyone to eat.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.350
This is really important
because we have some students coming in

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.952
who have tons of experience.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.187
You know,
they cook meals for their family at home.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.856
They're they've been baking for years.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.291
And then we have some students who this is
brand new for.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.396
And so they get to work together
and provide a meal for their peers.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.198
And as we

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.268
know, it's important that kids have enough
to eat to be able to learn.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.872
And so they realize that, oh,
I'm contributing positively

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:22.442
to my school environment
by providing everybody with enough food.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.446
It also is a way for them to practice
interacting

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.281
with one another in positive ways.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.284
And sometimes we all need practice
on that to,

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.418
yeah.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:36.890
So this has been a really great
opportunity for students to learn from one

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.260
another, to learn really important skills
that they'll need later in life.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.430
And to really contribute
positively to this school environment.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:46.266
That's great.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.801
How you feel okay with that over again?

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.904
Do you want to do it again? Do you?

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.905
Are you happy with that?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.908
I mean, I just I feel like it
would be different every time I said it.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.811
And so that is like
that has been my deliberate approach.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.346
Scripting anything.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:00.847
Yeah.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.448
It's going to come

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.317
but I feel like I hit
sort of like I didn't do

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.319
I know you would said like talk
about how the program started.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.354
But that is kind of a long story.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.057
So I kind of left little like you. Yeah.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.292
You paired it down really well.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.495
You got the nuts and bolts right away
and you focused on

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.498
how is that beneficial for students.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.633
And yeah that's great.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.170
And I just felt it was important
to acknowledge that like we have community

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.173
partners as well because it's a program
that wouldn't work if you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.509
if it was just the school doing it
it wouldn't work.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.913
So yeah I figured that would give people
some information.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.148
A little bit on that front.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.617
So so let let's that's still rolling.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:37.951
Okay.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:41.688
So, maybe you can speak to, you know,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.592
start off with how did you and get,
you know, how we engage the outside,

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:47.627
community members.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.094
Okay.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:52.398
So, I mean,
we are really lucky in our community,

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.535
that outside,
our organizations are actually constantly

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:58.905
looking out for our students
and have offered opportunities to us.
