WEBVTT

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.276
my name is Richard Beaudry.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:14.014
I'm a teacher of math and science
in grade eight, in the immersion program

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.548
at George Street
Middle School Middle School.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.451
As a math teacher and a science teacher.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.454
I try to see what,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.725
are the richest connecting points
between two subjects.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.095
So, for example,
I have the scientific principle

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.165
that I can better explore
using quantitative data.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.402
I will do that, and sometimes vice versa.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.773
I will try to have a map concept
that shines best through, a problem.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.676
I'll try to have a problem that we can
actually go to the park to solve.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.880
So, for example, if I want to discuss

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:51.484
the Pythagoras, I can do that by using a,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:56.890
I can do some math of the triangle
and of the slopes, but I can also

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.560
do something that includes marble slides
and something that's testable.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.797
If I want to talk about ratios,
I can discuss ratios in the classroom.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.200
We can, have, practice sheets.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.637
We can have, like, a bit of, like,
manipulative activity, but we can also

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:15.408
eventually go to, like,
go to a Bell Park and measure

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:20.146
some needs to answer a question,
such as is any given tree species,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.884
consistent in the ratio of men
to what to wish for?

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:29.489
And so those are examples of how
I'm trying to mesh, math and science.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:34.060
Science as a curriculum
will often be, leading towards,

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.796
like understanding

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.799
natural phenomenon through principles,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.802
exploring those principles through,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.006
experience, using those principles

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:51.444
that our knowledge of the,
material, towards final solution.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.447
So sustainability
would be an example of that.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.284
When we talk about a unit
such as a space unit, it's

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.855
hard to have just pure science of space
in the classroom.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.791
We don't have
that kind of billion dollar footprint.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.260
But at the same time, we do have,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.265
ways to, replicate
the conditions that we would face on

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:17.237
March on Mars in order to,
find a solution to a problem,

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:21.141
whether it be like lending or circulating
on a different planet,

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:26.212
or even like maintaining
a healthy lifestyle on a space station.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.381
So those are things we can do.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.283
So there's a bit of that in science.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:34.287
But as someone who would want to integrate
some math and looking DNA that feature,

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:38.491
so it's easy for me to just swap from
one to the other, I would integrate more,

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.629
more quantitative in the process.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.897
Having more quantitative,

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:48.368
having more data allows the students
to then measure things and crunch a bit

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:53.673
so that we have like, the quantitative
cross-referencing of the principal.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.341
Just to add the cherry in the sundae.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.479
I, I find this as a math teacher is quite,
cathartic is when you have

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.882
not only students who are gathering data
from something they're observing,

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.417
but then sharing the data.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.887
I don't know if I would quite call it
method analysis, but sharing enough data

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.289
so that the conclusion they're drawing

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.159
are not just from their own
little skewed experiment, but from,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.462
let's see, a collectively a collective
experiment where everybody's sharing data

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.831
that could be surprising at that time.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.868
And it gains a bit of like precision
in that sense.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.071
So I'd say that's, that's

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:29.742
probably one of my,
my go to high yield way to integrate math

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:34.113
and science context, having a bit
more quantitative data in an environment.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:37.717
Science environment where it's a bit
more geared towards principle

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:42.855
and experimentation and problem solving,
because we're dealing with predates,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.591
I find like things that the market here

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.860
appreciate our now with the ones
that I would consider more high yield.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.196
But at the same time we do appreciate it.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.299
And that's I guess
it's the surprising positive side effects.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.869
So for example, it is
it does help them understand better

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.938
what they manipulate something.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:02.542
It does help them motivate them
when they're being more creative

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:03.142
about something.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:07.447
So those are this practice
we know, they're also very thankful

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:11.017
when we just need to school and go to
a different environment to explore things.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.252
They just enjoyed that.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.587
They also enjoy a love being able
to share that with each other,

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.724
where you have like a board
with like a big, a big,

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.760
table where everybody inputs their data

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.164
that allows them to, have a sense
of what they just did, feels validated.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.033
They can compare a little bit
with the other students.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.068
It's almost like a
for quite a competition.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.104
Sometimes a competing,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.807
mind wouldn't have much of a space
in that data, but at the same time,

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:39.145
it allows them to make sense of it
and put it in context of bigger data.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:42.982
The just himself, which I think that's
one of those like, things

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:46.819
they really enjoy
and somehow make science make sense.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.822
In a way. It's, it's put in context.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.123
Yeah.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:54.260
The just the context of the principle
that it stems from, but also the context

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.097
of other people trying to apply those same
principles in a similar situation.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.734
I would say it would be so much

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.804
easier if in the

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.040
structure of the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.043
schedule, the year administration

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.480
gives you equal amount of math and science
for one given grade,

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:19.886
because the sheer fact of that schedule
will make everything more natural.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.723
You don't feel like you're fighting
against the current when that happens.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.093
Having the same kids
coming to you for math and science

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.863
and being introduced to the culture of,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.167
both classes serving each other

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:37.236
will come down over the course of a year
for me, actually.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:40.673
So if you show them in the math class
how to use this map concept,

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.844
and then you have a bit of more time
to explore time in, like,

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.880
exercise time,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.084
the this is something they've been doing
since beginning.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.187
But if you and then if you in science

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.623
use that math concept
and make it shine in a scientific context,

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.728
I think for the students,
it's definitely not as cathartic

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:05.098
as for the teacher, but it's definitely
something that will make sense to them.

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.065
It will come naturally.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.802
While if I take that concept from math
that someone else taught them in

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.839
the beginning,
science would say that's probably an extra

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.842
step for them to appreciate it.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.478
So that's the number one thing
as far as like

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.046
let's say that's already set in place.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.382
And I think teachers wants to give
that a try.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.418
I'd say like,
there's a habit of just thinking

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.688
science through the angle of measurability
in calculus ability

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.590
that will come with experience.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.626
I think the challenge is always to be able
to pin,

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:37.430
the activity that where the math
and science outcomes overlap,

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:42.502
because often you'll find, like project
based ideas where you have a science

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.139
experiment
that fits in the science curriculum.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.541
But when it comes to the math,
it becomes very simple math

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.544
that has fairly little to do with what
I'm supposed to teach in grade eight.

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.615
But when you're able to, like,
line up a quality graded math outcome

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.618
with a qualified outcome,
then you've got a bingo,

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.055
concept that in
that would have been seen once

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:06.926
and then gradually forgotten, stays alive

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.863
like, students will ask me sometimes,
why are we doing this concept?

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.433
We've already done this concept.
And the answer is simply

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.436
that it's a useful concept
used in the scientific context.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.672
So if a map concept comes back, comes back
once in a while,

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:22.842
then it becomes more a culture,
then a tick the box.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:26.512
If I can observe
in the scientific, papers

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:30.383
that the math concepts
that we've seen earlier a couple times,

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.251
by the time we reach the third time

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.620
frame, that they're not asking
the question anymore.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.056
Are they just going to ask
for a quick reminder or they say

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.091
they'll say something like,
oh, it's the Protagoras thing.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.394
We have to do this then, never mind.

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.363
Like we just
oh, are like, oh, you mean like,

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.834
so are we just using a ratio
like we did that time?

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.336
Yes. Okay. Well never mind,
I have a question.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:53.239
So like the, the culture of math becomes

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.742
almost like a prerequisite
for what we're doing.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:01.314
So in that sense, I think that's my way
to make it so natural to them

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.750
that it's not a fight between the students
and the outcome it becomes.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.787
The outcome is just part of the toolbox
for something else we're doing in science.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:09.622
I think what makes

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.592
me happy about that
combination is the fact that, like,

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.761
the sense of purpose is very high
and you're

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.765
you're still instilling a culture
of merging math and science together.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:23.569
It's not the only combination that exists,
but I think that I think that's

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.872
a rich one in a is a very useful one.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.039
It's purposeful.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.876
It's hard for them
when they're 13 to understand

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:34.080
the purpose of measuring leaves in a park,
to know the ratio of leaves.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.617
But their habit of like using math
and science together.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.487
And when we have the provincial assessment
and the compare

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.056
the little bit notes
between what they were able to accomplish

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:47.293
and what they were asked
to do, the science, for actual assessment,

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.963
it was itself quite underwhelming for them
for that reason, because they were like,

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.233
I understand that
there are things that we need to know, but

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:57.069
like, let's see, lab safety
and like scientific method.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.306
But the cyber, we're able
to like generate data from our experiment

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.442
and then compare data
that with other people is like

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:07.113
ten steps ahead, which I think
from the perspective of an educator.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.016
It's nice to see them appreciate that.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.150
Yeah.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.754
Yeah, it's a privilege in a way,
to be to have those two courses,

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.589
together in a schedule.

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:20.993
So I appreciate that part, but I'd say from the point of view of the students, it's

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.796
it's a very well combination.

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:24.130
Yeah.
