WEBVTT

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.044
So my name is Nathaniel Steeves,
and I'm a vice principal

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.079
at Birchmount School
and at Birchmount School.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.947
We have a lot of fun

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:17.617
and engaging activities for our students,
but also for our community members.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.620
One of those being the fall fair.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.456
And this happens
once a year, in the fall.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.559
And it's a great way for staff
to meet parents and guardians,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.927
but it's also a great way for the

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.464
the guardians and, and parents to meet us
and put a face to our names.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.735
It also allows the students
a little bit of of activity time,

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:39.005
where they also are engaging with staff
members who they might not be aware of.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.008
And this is done through a scavenger hunt
that we put together.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.079
And in that scavenger hunt, the students
and their parents or guardians

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.348
are going to different people
meeting the tech teacher,

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.351
meeting their face and teacher
based on the clues that they are given.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.354
The Fall fair also includes games

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.924
and some prizes that the students
and parents can win through those games.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.794
And we also include
culturally inclusive food.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.964
So we make sure that dietary restrictions
are are taken account for.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:06.533
The Fall Fair

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.636
came to be a few years ago
as a way to engage

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.039
the community and and bridge
the gap between home and school.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.874
It's a great way as a new person,

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.877
as a new member of the school community,
to meet members of the school.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.079
It creates that rapport.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.513
So when you are calling home

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:24.084
or when you are in meetings with parents,
you've already met most of them.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.487
And it allows for easier communication.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.957
At virtual school, we also have

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.993
movie nights and the movie nights.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.296
Are culturally responsive.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.498
They, our community friendly.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.300
They are kid friendly movies.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.770
We allow, parents and their children

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.873
to bring pillows, blankets, cozy chairs.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.876
This creates
a great environment for that.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.112
It's also a cheaper option
than going to the movies.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.481
This

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.484
came about again as a way
to involve the community members,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.620
but also to bridge that gap
between home and school.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:05.391
Also, we have bingo nights, that are,
that are held about every few months.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.193
These are great ways

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.864
for some competitive fun
and activities for people of all ages.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:15.768
All the students are invited, and
they're there with their family as well.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:20.173
Again, another low cost activity
where people can win, win prizes.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.610
We have staff members and sometimes
people in the home, in school

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.947
who call or making the calls,
So the overall benefits

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:32.785
to these, to these events
is that it builds stronger relationships.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.256
It creates rapport with the families
and community.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:40.226
It's also we're culturally inclusive,
and there's a sense of student

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.229
pride and motivation
with these activities as well.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:48.401
If a school was looking to implement
some of these activities and events,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.068
it's it's

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:53.072
great to have the support of, of a home
and school community or committee,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.043
which helps relieve some of the,

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:00.547
the planning on the school's part
so that bond with the home and school.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.017
The PSC certainly helps
to have community members

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.020
of volunteers who are able to come in
and get that started.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.354
Most of these events, the fall

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.424
fairs, is quite a bit of planning,
but bingo nights and movie nights are

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.692
are pretty low.
