Hi, my name is Kelsey Dunfield.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:14.114
I'm the behavior intervention mentor
at River Valley Middle School

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.348
in Grand Bay/Westfield.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.684
I get the opportunity
to run a lot of social groups.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.087
So I do some one on one with kids
as well as with social groups.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.824
And it's often for like skill streaming,
social awareness,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.827
emotional regulation,
everything like that.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.530
One of the things
that have been a really big hit

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.533
this year that I've run is the Preschool
buddies group.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.370
So a group of students,
who maybe need some connections

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.374
or a break from class or movement,
really all kinds of different reasons.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:45.478
We go over to the preschool
and we read to them, we play with them,

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:49.382
we engage, and it's really cool
to just see the see the students

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:54.387
follow the preschoolers lead and engage
in, because one of the other groups

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:58.191
that I did this year
that was a big hit was Sensory Explorers.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.693
So it was a lot of saline making.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.595
That's always what the kids want to do.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.166
But talking about the different senses
and relating it back to the curriculum

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.602
and,
and social emotional awareness through it.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.072
How does your body feel
when you play with this thing?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.174
How does your body feel
when you move around?

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.375
And things like that.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.177
So lots of exploration.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.013
I can
I can ask a kid to do something ten times,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.816
but if I don't have a connection
with them, they're not going to do it.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.951
So really, that's at the end of the day.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.353
Connection and safety and a feeling.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.656
Feeling trusted, feeling like they,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.660
we want them
to learn as much as they want to learn.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.795
And that's that's been huge.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:40.733
One of the biggest things that I use in
my practices would be, role playing.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.803
So role
play out the situations, social scenarios.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.139
What would you do
if you're in this situation?

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.907
And it's been a really helpful tool.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.876
And kids often feel silly,

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.546
while they're doing it, but afterwards
they go, hey, that made a lot of sense.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.483
Or like, I can actually do that.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.518
So it always helps them kind of figure.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.419
Figure it out.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.455
I've seen kids be able to come out,
come out of their shells

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.192
and form relationships
and connect with people.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:10.964
And I've seen some kids, when they walk
through the doors, they don't hide

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.200
or they don't put their hood
up to protect themselves.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:15.635
I've seen

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.439
the growth that they're able to come in
and feel welcomed and go to the office

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.543
and say, hi, Miss Conveyors and gation
and keep walking and come right to this.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.579
And then there's always a line of the kids
looking for me in the morning,

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.882
which I kind of love,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.885
because it just shows that they want
to be here and it's a safe space for them.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.020
So it's definitely, definitely helps.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.288
A lot of kids feel safe, I think.
