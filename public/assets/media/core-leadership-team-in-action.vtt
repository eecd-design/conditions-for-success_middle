00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.909
Hi. My name is

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.246
Judson Waye, principal of Doctor Losier
Middle School in Miramichi, New Brunswick.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.449
And I am here to talk about
the development of my core leadership team

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:20.887
and the distributive model of leadership
that we have in our school So today,

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:25.325
our core leadership team
meets every Tuesday morning for an hour.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.594
So it's embedded in our schedule.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:32.832
And the team focuses on not only,
operations of the building,

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:36.469
whether that's Challenge Cup or,
different things that we have going on.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:40.974
But it also is a key driver in terms
of what leadership needs to look like,

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.977
making sure staff
are living our core values,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.180
and making sure that everyone is informed

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.451
and has someone that they can,
they can advocate to it in a place?

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.653
So the desire to have a core leadership

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:57.190
team that was embedded
in, the day came from

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.460
first
we we realized, a couple of years ago

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.496
that we wanted to have
a core leadership group because we wanted

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.733
to, distribute
some of the leadership within the school.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.703
At that time, my vice principal
and I realized that the staff was really

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.807
just looking to us as administration
to make

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.942
all the decisions within the building.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.343
And they were very hands off.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:20.280
And that wasn't really the model
that we wanted.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.683
Wasn't a part of the vision,
whether it's at that time or now.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.455
And so we really wanted to make sure
that we had more voice in how,

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.924
decisions were made,
whether for operations

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.460
or within the leadership
structure of the school.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.230
We had initially started by having a group
that was meeting after school.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:41.301
And like anything, when it meets after
school, it gets busy and it gets hectic.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.304
And then people were missing meetings
and then we were canceling.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.440
So once we realized that we had to had
to embedded

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.544
in the operation of the of the school
and put it into the schedule.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.113
Then we started to have more success.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.950
The biggest tip that I would have
for any administrator

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.053
is to look into your schedule
and find a time in the day.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.289
I would suggest weekly
where your group can meet.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.892
It's really important
to have a diverse group.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.462
Not only just, your,
your administration,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.098
or even some of your SS folks.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.168
It's really important to have the voice
of teachers and other stakeholders.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.204
Make sure you have a good mix of male
versus female

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.973
and different ages on your staff.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:23.476
So all stakeholders can see themselves,
inside of the team.
