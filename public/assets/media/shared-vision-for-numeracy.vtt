00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.776
My name is Heather Dickson.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.611
I'm the principal of Marshview
Middle School.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.315
And today I wanted to talk
about our school improvement goal

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.451
with numeracy
and a shared vision for our school.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.523
We wanted to tackle attitudes,
in our students,

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.494
towards numeracy, and we wanted to build
grit and resilience.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:32.399
When it came to looking at problems
where they didn't know the easy answer.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.436
We allocated our advisory period was,

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.506
which is an extra 25 minutes a day

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.208
towards numeracy practice.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.645
Our entire school, spent that 25 minutes

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.249
engaged in mathematics
activities and games.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:52.152
We wanted to foster a love of math.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.388
And this really started with the adults
in the building.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.758
So often you hear, oh, I'm
not a math person.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.695
And so it was changing the attitudes
from the top down

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.199
to say, well, mathematicians,
we use math every day.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:12.138
And it was to foster a sense of love,
of numbers within our student body.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.711
So during those advisory periods, they
would work on our collective problems.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.649
We used estimation 180 a lot,
but it was about finding the joy

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.786
in working with math, seeing problems
all the way through to the end

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.521
when things got challenging,

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.891
if things had a different way
of tackling the question.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.128
We really wanted to celebrate
that with our students.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.498
The culmination activity and

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.535
a long standing activity at Mars View
Middle School is our math Olympics.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.705
Students are grouped in, groups of four.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:50.110
There's a grade five, six, a seven
and an eight student on our teams.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.113
And they visit different stations, for

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.449
about five minutes,
and they tackle grade level math problems.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.253
And so if you're a grade eight student,
you finish your grade eight question.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:05.291
But then you're able to help the others
on your team, try to solve their problems

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.061
because the activities
are only five minutes.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.597
The students know, okay, I'll buckle down.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.798
I'll really try on this.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.801
And if it's really frustrating
or it's stopping me,

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.537
we know that we're moving on
in five minutes.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:21.107
We found that our attendance increases
that day.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:24.210
The amount of office referrals is none,

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.547
and it is a really exciting way

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.517
to engage with math all afternoon.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.485
So our efforts paid off.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.256
And one of the things that we found
was the overall general attitude

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.726
towards math to,
you know, engaging with numbers

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:43.062
to seeing through, problems
until the very end.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.932
The attitude towards math increased.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.200
The students had fun.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.503
They were able to see their French
teacher become their math

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.506
teacher, their Ela
teacher become their math teacher.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.578
And, really fostered
a sense of a love for numbers.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:03.550
We also engaged our families
where we sent home weekly

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.618
probability activities.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:08.288
They went out on the Friday before.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:13.092
They had to be handed in the Wednesday
for every family that created one,

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.828
or that finished
one of the math activities,

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.132
they were put into a draw
that won a family game night.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.969
And so there was drinks, popcorn,
and then some sort of a math game,

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.005
whether that was a crib board and cards,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.542
or various
math, math games that we found on Amazon.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:35.248
But it got the sense of community and
our families talking about math as well.
