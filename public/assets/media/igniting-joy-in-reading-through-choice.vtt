00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.343
My name is Sara Belong, and I

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:14.180
teach English language at grade
six here at George Street Middle School.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.151
So as a classroom teacher,
I am working on applying basic

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.088
universal design
for learning strategies with my students.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:27.260
When it comes to reading at the grade
six level, I do often have kids

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.765
that don't like reading or struggle
with reading at grade level.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.002
So I like to give the kids all choice

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.039
as opposed to me
telling them what they have to read.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:43.610
I like to give choice in the format
of the books that I offer the kids.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.613
So I have a lot of graphic novels
in the classroom.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.582
I have shorter novels in verse.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:55.255
I have a lot of poetry books,
and I really like to give them the choice

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.458
to with how they read. Examples are

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:02.162
I like them to have the choice
to listen to the book as an audiobook.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:06.232
I do read alouds where they can sit back
and I read them the book.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.137
I love to do partner readings
where the kids get to sit with a friend

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:15.675
and each have a copy of the same book,
and either read it out loud together

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.778
or in their heads together,
but then they can discuss

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.815
the, the book with each other
when they're when they're done.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.852
I really enjoy trying to find out
what the kids are interested in,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:30.857
and I make every effort
to get books about those topics.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.127
Just to boost the interest

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.163
in reading and help them
increase their volume of reading.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.733
And there's nothing better than a student

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.970
being able to say, I finished this book.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.373
I think that it helps them
to have a writer's

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.376
identity
as they move up into the higher grades.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.080
They now are in the conversation
about books

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.484
and they can say, I have read that,
and here's what I thought of it

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:03.556
over the last few years of me implementing
this choice in reading for the kids.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:08.661
I have seen a huge growth in the volume
that the kids are reading,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.031
and just the joy of reading
like hearing the buzz of them

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.069
talk to each other
about what they've read is amazing.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:20.406
And yes, that does translate
into their literacy abilities too,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.208
with reading and writing.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:27.180
So a strategy that was shown to me
is called First Chapter Fridays,

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.617
where every Friday I'll read a chapter

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.620
or even just part of a chapter
of a new book that I've got.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.925
And the hope is that the kids will become
interested, and they always do.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.128
So I'll read the first chapter,
kind of leave them hanging,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.365
and then say,
who would like to now borrow this book?

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.768
And that little tweak in how I do things

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:53.273
has improved their volume
of reading and their joy for reading

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.241
a lot.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.912
They all want that book
that I just read the first chapter,

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:03.082
because often a closed book on the shelf
that they know nothing about.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.189
A reluctant reader just isn't going to
joyfully go and pick a book, right?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.257
They need to be led into it.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:17.897
So if you are trying to provide choice
for your students for reading,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:22.902
I would suggest getting
as many different books as you can.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.272
You know, provide
a variety of books in your classroom,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.609
a variety of genres for them to pick from,

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:34.847
and if you have the ability
to offer them an iPad with headphones

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:39.485
so that they can listen to audiobooks,
I think that would be a really good start.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.555
My my take on this is,

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:47.026
the days of forcing kids
to all read the same book

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.029
and making them love that book are gone.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:55.235
We need to get to know our kids first,
find out what they're interested

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.036
in, what makes them tick,

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:01.541
and then try to bring text
into your classroom that support that.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.144
And you will see
your kids fly with reading.
