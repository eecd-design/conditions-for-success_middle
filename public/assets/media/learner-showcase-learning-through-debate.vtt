Hello.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.546
My name is Penny, and I'm a grade
8 student in Port Elgin school. Hi.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.649
My name is Melody and I am a grade
seven student at Port Elgin school.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:21.688
And we're going to be talking about
our debate, PBL and how we presented the,

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:27.827
so the people's like if we took classes

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:32.032
under debate, learning
how to pay for eight weeks.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.634
And at the end we did a showcase,

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.539
our showcase was a Canadian
parliamentary style debate

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.474
where we went against another team

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.445
of two girls and debated our case,
which was this house.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.380
We took what it should be feared.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.383
We were on side gov,
which was for the resolution.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.455
So we took turns going up to the podium

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.925
and saying or arguments to why

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.928
we believe that technology should be fair.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.697
And we listened

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.767
to the other team
and opposed their arguments

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.905
and we won in the end.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.540
We did a video showcase.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.507
It was in the afternoon.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:18.945
We did a new format where parents
and family members were able to come

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:22.649
through and watch the debate, and that's
when we did our debate at the showcase.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:28.621
I really enjoyed the showcase
because it was really fun to, like,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.058
learn how to,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.361
learn how to like,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:41.668
debate and argue in a respectful way
where you're getting your point across

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:45.538
with less emotions and to the community

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.142
and the way that was fun.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.912
I like this showcase because it was just
a different way of doing things,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.915
which I thought was really fun
because we were able to interact with

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.918
other people who are in the PBL with us.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.055
teachers should like really

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.757
push new students to try

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.094
new ways of presenting their projects

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.931
and things that they've tried
before, like,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.569
slideshows or stuff like that.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.837
I agree with Penny.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.005
I would say the teachers

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:22.275
push your students to do something new
because it helps them feel more

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:25.745
engaged and feel more like they're
actually doing something in the subjects,

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.716
instead of just making a presentation
and typing stuff in the slides.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.719
It's more fun.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.420
You have the ability
to do something like that.
