00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.609
Hi, I'm Leroy Vincent.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.912
I'm the technology, art and shop
specialist here at River

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.014
Valley Middle School.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.950
So we run a five day a week,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.186
hot lunch program that students
are the only ones who do it.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.789
And it's, it's a mentorship program.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.792
So when we when I started it,
when I came in from engineering,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:30.730
all I kept hearing was how the student
teacher ratio was too high.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.299
It was 26 to 1, 28 to 1.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.669
So I set up a mentorship
program started in grade six.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:41.608
All kids would learn cooking, food,
safety, entrepreneurship,

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.777
how to do budgeting,
how to do spreadsheets,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.780
how to keep inventory,
how to recycle inventory,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.817
how to incorporate food safety
into the into the, program

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:55.121
and what the students would do is
they would mentor other students.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.125
So instead of a 26 to 1 ratio,
we went from probably,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.962
you know, sometimes five, five mentors
plus a teacher.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.697
So it would be, you know,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:08.401
six teachers in the room
bringing kids from all grade levels.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.404
And then they'd all take part in the
in the hot lunch program.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.643
Some students, for whatever the reason,
may not be able to afford lunch.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:21.314
We kind of focus on a lot of them doing
the cooking, but no kid would go hungry.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.051
And the idea of it is it's
not a moneymaker, it's to break even.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.888
So the kids learned how to do a budget
that's part of the grade six thing.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.390
Grade six program.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.925
They do Excel spreadsheets.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.662
They got to research what
all the ingredients are, what they cost,

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.865
and what like rate down
to a slice of pizza.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:43.103
How much of that would be profit
and how much of it would be a loss?

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:48.208
So some some lunches lose purpose,
they lose and some lunches make.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.710
But the idea at the end of the week
it's a break even.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.112
So all kids just pay.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.115
What they're paying for
is exactly what it cost to make it.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.916
And it's all made by students.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.719
There's
I mean, I'm here, but it's all students.
