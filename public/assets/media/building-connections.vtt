00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.309
My name is Jaime

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.312
Hunter, and I'm the music specialist
at Birchmount School.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.382
And I'm going to be speaking to you
about implementing

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.351
personnel and student relationships.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:23.089
So at virtual school,
we have many different ways of finding

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.494
connection, whether it be through students
who have been in Canada for a long time.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.765
Newcomer students, it doesn't
really matter where someone's from.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.468
We make an effort to make sure
that people feel a sense of belonging

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.737
at our school.

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.741
It isn't necessarily a bullet point
in our initiatives, but it's a value that

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.311
we hold to make sure that our students
are feeling engaged

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.381
and enriched and empowered
in their learning and themselves.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.886
Here in my space,
in the music side of things.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.021
When students come to my room
and let's say

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.425
I don't actually know who they are,
which is not super common

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:02.362
because I have had a lot of students from
kindergarten up through to middle school.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.898
But let's say
if I didn't know who they were.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.901
One of my first activities
that I do is a listing on.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.638
They give me their favorite
song of the moment or perhaps

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.241
favorite songs from childhood,
and they share that with me,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:19.012
and we use it to talk
through the elements of music

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.750
in an objective way and talking
to students about subjectivity.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.786
So what they like or don't like versus
what is actually there.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.891
And I found through a model like that
of focusing on the students choice

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.294
that many other students in their class,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.430
maybe, who also don't know
the student yet, find a way to connect

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.164
to that student.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.000
That's a great way to engage with.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.169
Well, where did you find that song?

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.604
Who share that with you?

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.406
Why do you like that so much?

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.175
And it gives them a moment
to be uplifted in my space,

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.178
to in other spaces in our school.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.615
For example, in an English language
arts classroom.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.152
I know that there are teachers
in our building to run a book club,

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.323
so they offer a few different books
for the class to choose from.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:07.160
And through that process,
students grouped themselves off

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.596
with that method.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.232
Students are able to engage
with other learners.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.235
They get to read through chapters,
but teachers can also go and ask

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:19.105
very similar questions,
such as why did you choose this book?

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.441
What do you connect
with as your characters

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.977
remind you of yourself
or someone you know?

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.014
And finding ways to really build
that in our school

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.251
has this really beautiful gift,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:36.055
kindness and finding ways
to uplift everyone around them.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.391
So whether you're running

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.961
an extra curricular group or an not,
I run a couple at this school.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.231
Being able to highlight the wins.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:49.402
We have a morning announcement group
who highlight all of the wins

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:54.807
that are submitted by teachers of sports
games or maybe different rehearsals

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:59.512
going on towards drama festival
or a tour for music.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.616
Or maybe there's a group
that's going to a Dungeons and Dragons

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.918
event for the district.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.653
There are many things that go on.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:10.890
And so finding ways to engage in that
and give your gift as a teacher.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:16.462
So something that is, low energy
or effort for you that gets a high reward.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.331
So for me, I run a choir.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.265
I run a rock band

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:24.070
to find that engagement with the students
and really let them know that we're here.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.206
Let's make some community.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.140
Let's make some music.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.942
Let's have a good time together.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.044
But taking time to to put that in.
