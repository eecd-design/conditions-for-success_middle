Hi. My name is Wyatt and I'm a grade seven
in Marshview Middle School.

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:15.366
Today I'm going to show some examples
of student on student working.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.566
And I'm going to talk about how we sustain

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.366
a sense of community where students

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:26.033
actively work together.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.166
And I really like how

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.233
we started this engage a program.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.333
I've done it since I was in grade five.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.933
Tried out a few different things,
but I really like the trades engage

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.500
and how it caught my eye
because the trading age I found

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.833
really helped me learn a lot of things
for in school and outside of school,

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:52.466
and taught me to work with students
and people a lot better in life.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:57.366
And I wasn't so bossy and like,
kind of controlling.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.866
So it really taught me a lot.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.133
Like me and my friends that knew

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.966
how to do things in that trading age
already.

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.466
We're helping people learn,
and we're we were using our own knowledge

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:16.500
to help people, but at the same time,
we were still learning some new stuff

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.433
to add on to our knowledge.

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:30.900
And I really liked how

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.233
I can come from school
and go to my job that saw it,

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:37.700
and then I can still take that knowledge
that I learned

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.700
from the trades, engage,
and go straight to my job.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.666
Like I had to build a shed at my job
the other day and I didn't.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.333
If I wanted to tuck in my trades, engage.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.966
I want to know how to build a wall
for the shed.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:56.300
And that really helped a lot of us
that we really need.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.300
Like even if we were split into groups,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.800
we would still check on each other
and see if we all needed help.

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.700
I really liked how we all work together,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.966
even if we were split into groups,
we still stuck together and work together,

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:16.900
and we tell each other
a lot from each of our knowledge.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.933
And the teacher really helped us out.

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:24.966
But always putting in good words for us
and always saying how good we are,

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:29.766
but still teaching us and giving us that
hard time, but not too hard of a time.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:33.466
And it really helped me

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.800
because it gave me something
to look forward to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.900
when I wanted to come to school, because
before we started this trades engage.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.066
I don't want to come to school
now that we started this trades engage.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.466
I want to come to school all the time.
