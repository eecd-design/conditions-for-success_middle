00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.844
Hi. My name is Ryan Slashinsky.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.781
I'm a teacher here at Marshview
Middle School in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.051
So this, project, this story

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.054
actually starts
with, a student initiative.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:26.092
I had I've been teaching,
a lot of, music.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.560
I've been teaching lots of drama.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.031
And, as part of my regular,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.700
programing at the school.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.935
But also a lot of extracurricular.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:40.840
So I've been, every couple of years
I've directed a school musical,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.978
and we've put that on very large
scale productions.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.848
And we've had, the opportunity
to involve,

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:52.585
over half of the, the school
in each of those productions, like.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.855
But when it comes down
to props and costumes and designing

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.292
and building sets and all of the things
that go around putting together

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.163
such a large scale production,
it involves so many people.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.734
So over half of the staff
and students of the school at some point

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.738
are contributing something towards
that, large community project,

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.508
which is really exciting and fun
to see, that passion go into that work.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:19.279
So the students, have had some experience
working,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:23.183
in, theatrical productions
and putting them together.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:28.221
And that, often inspires them to start
to think of their own,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.524
initiatives and creativity, and wanting

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.694
to put that in and wanting to do that,
put that into practice.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.565
So the question I get asked
most often at the end of the musical is,

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.433
okay, what are we doing next?

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.736
So, yeah,
this this story starts with a student

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:48.942
who, was super into the theater,
had such a great time doing

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.645
the musical, wanted to do something else,
right away.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.748
And he decided
he was going to write his own, show.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.285
So, he came to

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.123
me, he approached me, and he said, like,
I want to write this show.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:08.595
Can I use the school, resources, the
costumes, the props, that kind of stuff?

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.630
Absolutely. For sure. No problem.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.901
And, then through this project, as

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.705
he got started and got got going with it,
other kids got involved.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.440
He put together a whole crew.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.941
He had a co-writer.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:26.846
Then there was the actors involved, and
I helped him go through the process of,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.018
not only writing this show,
but mounting it, putting it together.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.321
So that was done through,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.625
my involvement
with other community organizations.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.628
So, I work with a local community
theater group.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:47.333
I knew that that, they had, well,
we have a theater space.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.304
I knew that we needed a space for
for this,

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.607
burgeoning group to put on their play.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:58.044
So I put those two in touch, and I, I

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.748
there was a theater festival
that was happening in a few weeks.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.751
I said, let's put together this show
and let's apply

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.154
to put it on,
at the local community theater festival.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.391
And, they were accepted, of course.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:15.895
You know, having kids
in, in the festival was, amazing

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:20.066
and such a wonderful experience
for not only the kids and for the parents,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:25.471
but like, the audience was packed, as
it often is, with, with kids productions.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.675
They, they brought their fan clubs
to come and see.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.778
And so, it was a boon to the community

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.415
festival of such,
an exciting event, for everyone.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:39.152
And then to see these kids
that had gone from,

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.956
not knowing how to do anything
to putting together completely

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.959
on their own,
with minimal involvement from me,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:49.829
their, their own show from beginning
to end, writing it, directing it,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.366
casting it, the acting,
the rehearsal process,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.403
finding, designing all of the costumes
and props and sets and all of that.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:01.241
You know, they
they worked on that on their own, with,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.210
just some guidance from me.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.215
So that was really exciting to see them
go from, again, from that process of,

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:13.519
not knowing how to do anything in theater
to putting together

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.489
their own show from
scratch. Pretty cool. Yeah.
