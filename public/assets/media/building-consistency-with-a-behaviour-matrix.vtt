00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.943
So my name is Sandra Savard.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.146
I'm the principal at Birchmount School
in Moncton in Anglophone East.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.849
I'm here to talk to you
about our behavior matrix,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.552
which we call our bare necessities,
because we are the birch mount bears.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.056
Our process to get there was one
that was slow.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.895
It did involve a lot of conversations
and a lot of debates among teachers.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:34.334
We took some dedicated professional
learning time to really dig down into what

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.872
our expectations common expectations
are for us, for our students.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.242
We identified major areas
within the school,

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.647
such as the classroom,
the playground, the washrooms, and to talk

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.750
about what we wanted our students
to demonstrate in those areas.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.522
Then we did also identified
our expectations among and we

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.159
we identified themes

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.762
that aligned
with how we wanted our students to behave.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.364
And those were to be safe.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.198
We wanted our birch

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:08.601
mount bears to be respectful,
and we wanted our bears to be responsible.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:13.273
So we took each one of those themes,
aligned it with an area, and came up

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:18.578
with 3 or 4 positive statements
on what we wanted our students to be in.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.679
Those areas.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.350
Things like, bears are responsible
by taking care of their materials

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.718
in the classroom.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:29.956
Bears are safe
by following the playground rules.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.693
So each one of those areas has somewhere

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:37.530
between 9 to 12 statements

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.401
that align with being safe, respectful,
and responsible in those specific areas.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.405
One of the biggest piece
that the benefits of the matrix has given

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:49.175
us is a common language, a common language
for us to use with students,

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.477
a common language for us to use

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:53.746
with our colleagues, and a common language
to help us with communication home.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.517
That consistent language helped us

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:02.355
to anchor conversations
both with students, staff and home,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.559
and also help to show
that we are reunited at Birch Mount

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.296
and that we're all on the same team
in regards to our expectations

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.733
in the classroom, on the playground,
or in the washroom, etc..

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.903
My advice for schools

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:20.640
who are looking at embarking
on this journey and PBIs

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.477
and creating their own behavior
matrix is to go slow.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:29.082
Be ready for conflict
and for people to disagree.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.752
We recognize that teachers
can be very passionate about what

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.755
they want to see in their classroom,
what they want to see on the playground.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.959
But once you agree and you come up
with that consistent language,

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.897
you are committed as a team to make sure
that that's what we're following

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.998
through on.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.535
Also, consistent communication about your

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.538
your behavior matrix
and your expectations.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.041
So make sure that you continue
to have regular conversations,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.078
including it in your newsletters,
including and in your staff communication,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.949
and also included it in on
morning announcements with our students.
