			<div class="accordion-group">
				<Accordion title={"Initiating"}>
					<PhaseIcons phase={"initiating"} slot="button-icon" />
					<p>
						If a school is in the Initiating Phase, they have not

						elsewhere.
					</p>
				</Accordion>

				<Accordion title={"Implementing"}>
					<PhaseIcons phase={"implementing"} slot="button-icon" />
					<p>
						If a school is in the Implementing Phase, they have a
						plan for how to implement and they have likely observed
						some examples of progress and achievement. At this
						point, they'll need to decide whether implementation is
						a priority or not, as it will take time and dedication.
					</p>

				<Accordion title={"Developing"}>
					<PhaseIcons phase={"developing"} slot="button-icon" />
					<p>
						If a school is in the Developing Phase, they have some

				It can deepen and extend the work already being done.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>Conditions for Success Developmental Continuums</em> framework
				is designed to deepen and extend the work already underway in schools
				through the <a
					href="https://nbed.github.io/school-improvement-indicators/"
					>Provincial School Improvement Indicators</a
				>, district-based goals, and improvement planning processes.
				While the four provincial domains: Systemic School Planning,
				Leadership and Teaming, Instructional Practices, and Learning
				Environments, remain consistent across grades K-12, this
				framework offers Middle Program Block-level teams a practical,
				learner-centered lens to support ongoing improvement and can
				even help schools use the Response to Intervention (RTI)
				framework more effectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Specifically developed for the unique needs of young
				adolescents, the framework helps Middle Schools:
			</p>
			<ul class="checklist" data-theme="red">
				<li>
					<IconCheckmark />
					<span>
						<strong>Clarify priority areas</strong> by reflecting on
						their current level of implementation, from Initiating to
						Sustaining, across “The Big Seven” indicators.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<IconCheckmark />
					<span>
						<strong
							>Align daily practice with provincial and district
							goals</strong
						> by strengthening the connection between what happens in
						the Middle Program Block and the broader School Improvement
						Planning (SIP) process.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<IconCheckmark />
					<span>
						<strong>Maintain local autonomy</strong> by guiding schools
						in determining how to move forward within what has been established
						by provincial and district expectations.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<IconCheckmark />
					<span>
						<strong>Deepen shared understanding</strong> and collaboration
						among staff, which contributes to sustained progress and
						builds internal capacity for change.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<IconCheckmark />
					<span>
						<strong>Use evidence intentionally</strong>, making the
						continuum a tool for both celebration and critical
						reflection during SIP monitoring and review cycles.
					</span>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Overall, the framework is a scaffold to help schools move from
				broad aspirations to focused actions, while supporting the
				sustained practices that are aligned with their SIP goals.
