				Early adolescence matters!
			</p>
			<p>
				While early childhood is renowned for its rapid neural growth,
				adolescence represents another critical phase of heightened
				plasticity and neural refinement. This stage is vital for
				shaping lifelong behaviours, supporting mental health, and
				fostering academic growth.

							<p>
								This stage of life is marked by substantial

								highlight the importance of providing the right
								supports to make the most of this opportunity.

							<p>
								Adolescence brings increased sensation-seeking,

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				We also know that our Middle Schools play a pivotal role in
				shaping the trajectories of our Middle School Learners. By
				fostering responsive relationships and creating networks of
				belonging, schools can activate adolescents' sense of agency and
				engagement in their learning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, for learners who have not yet achieved proficiency
				in literacy and numeracy, adolescence offers a critical moment
				for targeted support. The brain’s capacity for learning during
				this period allows for meaningful progress through
				evidence-based, responsive teaching practices.

				By using “The Big Seven” developmental continuums!
			</p>
			<p>
				The Conditions for Success Developmental Continuums span seven
				key indicators, called “The Big Seven.” These continuums, which
				are rooted in the Holistic Curriculum Framework and align with
				research-based practices, together comprise a comprehensive
				framework for NB Middle Schools. Schools can use this framework
				to create responsive, inclusive, and empowering environments
				that meet the unique needs of adolescents.
