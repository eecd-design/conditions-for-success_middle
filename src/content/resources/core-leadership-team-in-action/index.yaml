  This video highlights the role of the Core Leadership Team in fostering
  distributive leadership within the school. The team brings together a diverse
  group of educators who meet weekly during the school day to reflect on core
  values, guide school operations, and advocate for staff. Their collaborative
  approach ensures that leadership is shared, decisions are informed, and the
  schoolâ€™s vision is consistently lived out in practice.
