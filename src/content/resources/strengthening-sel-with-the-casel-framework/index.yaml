  At River Valley Middle School, educators are using the CASEL framework to make
  social-emotional learning part of everyday practice. From greetings at the
  door to brain breaks, mindfulness, and exit slips, staff are building skills
  in self-awareness, relationships, and social awarenessâ€”all while creating a
  culture where learners feel seen and supported.
