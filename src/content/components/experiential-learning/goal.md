In experiential learning, learners engage in a relevant learning experience that connects directly to the world around them. This experience follows the continuous cycle of experiential learning: experience, reflect, think, apply, and experience again.

Through these experiences, learners can demonstrate agency, make authentic decisions, and be impacted by what they do and discover. The process invites them to reflect on their experience, think about what it means, and then apply those insights in new and meaningful ways.
