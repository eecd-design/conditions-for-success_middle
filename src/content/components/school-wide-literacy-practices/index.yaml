        Direct instruction (0.59) focuses on isolated skills rather than deeper
        meaning (e.g., educators explicitly define literary terms before reading
        but do not connect them to learners’ unique strengths or prior
        knowledge).
      compass: false
    - tag: 6.2.2
      description: >-
        Vocabulary instruction (0.67) relies on word lists rather than
        developing thematic and technical vocabulary across learning areas
        (e.g., learners memorize definitions instead of using new vocabulary to
        communicate effectively in writing and discussions).
      compass: false
    - tag: 6.2.3
      description: >-
        Summarizing (0.63) and note-taking (0.59) involve copying text rather
        than connecting reading and writing or increasing stamina (e.g.,
        learners complete fill-in-the-blank summaries rather than constructing
        their own responses to texts).
      compass: false
    - tag: 6.2.4
      description: >-
        Questioning (0.48) is recall-based, with minimal opportunities to seek
        clarification or evaluate and respond to ideas (e.g., educators ask,
        “What happened in the story?” rather than prompting learners to explain
        author’s intent or argumentation strategies).
      compass: false
    - tag: 6.2.5
      description: >-
        Assessment is summative, with little formative feedback for learners to
        reflect and grow as independent readers and writers.
