        Direct instruction focuses on isolated skills rather than deeper meaning
        (e.g., educators explicitly define literary terms before reading but do
        not connect them to learners’ unique strengths or prior knowledge).

        Vocabulary instruction relies on word lists rather than developing
        thematic and technical vocabulary across learning areas (e.g., learners
        memorize definitions instead of using new vocabulary to communicate
        effectively in writing and discussions).

        Summarizing and note-taking involve copying text rather than connecting
        reading and writing or increasing stamina (e.g., learners complete
        fill-in-the-blank summaries rather than constructing their own responses
        to texts).

        Questioning is recall-based, with minimal opportunities to seek
        clarification or evaluate and respond to ideas (e.g., educators ask,
        “What happened in the story?” rather than prompting learners to explain
        author’s intent or argumentation strategies).

        Reciprocal teaching is introduced, allowing learners to use talk to own
        thinking and understanding through peer discussions (e.g., in pairs,
        learners take turns leading discussions about a shared text, practicing
        predicting, questioning, clarifying, and summarizing).

        Vocabulary instruction is embedded in reading and writing activities,
        leveraging prior knowledge to support meaning-making across texts (e.g.,
        before reading XX, learners connect historical context to the novel’s
        themes, increasing stamina and engagement).

        Summarizing and note-taking are modeled, with learners beginning to
        apply these strategies independently to reference texts for verification
        (e.g., learners use graphic organizers to track key ideas while reading
        a novel and develop their own interpretations).

        Class discussion and cooperative learning emerge, allowing learners to
        begin supporting and defending their ideas with evidence (e.g., after
        reading an editorial, learners engage in a structured debate, practicing
        evaluating and responding to multiple viewpoints).

        Formative assessment is used, but learners rely on the educator for
        corrections rather than reflecting authentically on their progress
        (e.g., learners complete exit tickets, but reflection is still prompted
        by the educator rather than learner-initiated).

        Reciprocal teaching, questioning, and self-questioning are learner-led,
        allowing them to seek information and analyze critically (e.g., learners
        generate their own discussion questions, make connections between texts,
        and clarify misunderstandings in small groups).

        Metacognitive strategies are used to reflect on and apply feedback from
        others (e.g., learners write reading reflections, identifying challenges
        and strategies they used to understand the text and how they plan to
        adjust).

        Cooperative learning and peer tutoring promote deeper engagement in
        assessing self and others (e.g., learners provide structured peer
        feedback on each other’s essays, using a rubric to guide constructive
        critique).

        Class discussion and formal discussions (e.g., Socratic seminars,
        debates) are learner-driven, reinforcing the importance of supporting
        and extending understanding (e.g., learners facilitate their own
        Socratic seminar, analyzing how texts convey societal values and
        perspectives).

        Self-questioning and metacognitive strategies are routine, allowing
        learners to read and write to learn about self, world, and others (e.g.,
        learners annotate texts independently, making inferences and drawing
        personal connections without educator prompts).

        Scaffolding is dynamic, with learners adjusting their own supports as
        needed (e.g., some learners choose audiobooks, annotation tools, or
        graphic organizers that best support their comprehension needs.)

        Class discussions are fully learner-led, with deeper textual analysis
        supporting questioning and analyzing situations (e.g., in a
        learner-moderated debate, participants cite multiple texts as evidence
        for their arguments and challenge opposing perspectives constructively).

        Formal discussions (e.g., structured debates, peer-led literature
        circles) replace educator-led questioning (e.g., learners explore
        multiple representations by analyzing a novel, documentary, and opinion
        article on the same topic, comparing perspectives).

        Formative assessment is fully integrated, with learners self-regulating
        their learning and demonstrating knowledge by writing for a variety of
        purposes (e.g., learners track their growth over time using a reading
        and writing portfolio, setting personalized literacy goals based on
        feedback from peers and educators).
