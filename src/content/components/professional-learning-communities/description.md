The Four Guiding Questions for Professional Learning Communities (PLCs):

1. What do learners need to know, understand, and be able to do?
2. How will we know if each learner has learned it?
3. How will we respond when some learners have difficulty learning it?
4. What will we do if a learner already knows it?
