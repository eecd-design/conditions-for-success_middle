Educators intentionally design instruction that supports **surface, deep, and transfer learning,** recognizing that each phase is essential for student growth. While **surface learning** builds foundational knowledge, **deep learning** fosters conceptual understanding, and **transfer learning** ensures students can apply their knowledge in new and unfamiliar situations. The ultimate goal is for students to **generalize their learning across contexts,** preparing them to think critically and solve problems beyond the classroom.
