Remove barriers and optimize learning for all by proactively designing lessons that offer multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression. UDL ensures all learners can access and participate in meaningful learning.

**Note:** Differentiation and Universal Design for Learning are different, yet they complement one another. **Universal Design for Learning** is about designing lessons that work for *everyone* from the start. **Differentiation** is about adjusting learning for *specific learners or groups* once you see what they need. Educators often blend both: lessons are built with **UDL** so all learners can access the learning, and then educators **differentiate** based on student data or readiness to give extra support or challenge.
