        Educators learn the foundational concepts of UDL—multiple means of
        engagement, representation, and expression. They occasionally adapt
        materials for certain learners, but it’s often reactive rather than
        proactive.

        Learning experiences are mostly uniform; learners with identified
        justified accommodations receive individual supports, but not all
        learners benefit from universally-designed lessons.

        Educators receive introductory sessions on UDL frameworks and
        guidelines. School leaders begin discussing implementation essentials.

        Educators incorporate strategies such as varied media (e.g., video,
        audio, text) for content, flexible seating options, and multiple ways
        for learners to show learning (e.g., presentations, writing, art).

        Learners start to see more choices in how they engage with content
        (e.g., reading vs. listening) and demonstrate learning. Supports (e.g.,
        closed captions, graphic organizers) are more widely available.

        Educators collaborate to share practical UDL tools and plan lessons with
        at least one UDL principle in mind (e.g., multiple means of
        representation).

        UDL is systematically applied. Educators proactively plan for learner
        variability, offering multiple avenues for engagement (e.g., choice
        menus, learner goal setting), representation (e.g., visuals,
        simulations, texts at various reading levels), and expression (e.g.,
        written, oral, digital).

        Learners benefit from diverse ways to interact with content and show
        their understanding. They develop metacognitive skills by choosing
        strategies that suit their needs.

        Teams conduct lesson studies or peer observations focusing on UDL
        application. Data is used to reflect on how well UDL practices remove
        barriers and improve learner outcomes.

        All lessons, activities, and assessments are designed from the outset to
        be accessible and challenging for every learner. UDL is second nature,
        with ongoing innovation and sharing of best practices.

        Learners take ownership of their learning, frequently self-selecting
        resources, strategies, and modes of expression. They view “barrier-free”
        learning as the norm.

        UDL is infused in professional learning, coaching, and evaluation
        processes. Leaders and educators continuously refine practices based on
        research and learner data.
