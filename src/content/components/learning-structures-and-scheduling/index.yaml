        STRUCTURE: The school day is divided into fixed periods (e.g., Period 1:
        Mathematics, Period 2: Science), with each learning area taught in
        isolation. Learners transition between classes based on a rigid
        timetable.

        EDUCATOR COLLABORATION: Minimal interdisciplinary planning. Educators
        focus on individual learning area instruction with limited opportunities
        for cross-curricular connections.

      description: >-
        LEARNER EXPERIENCE: Learners move from one learning area to another
        without explicit connections between content areas. Learning remains
        compartmentalized.

      categories:
        - Learner Experience
    - tag: 1.3.4
      description: >-
        INFORMAL LEARNING: Limited unstructured time. Informal learning
        primarily occurs in brief recesses, lunch breaks, or before/after
        school.

        - Informal Learning
    - tag: 1.3.5
      description: >-
        SHOWCASE OF LEARNING: Learner achievements are typically assessed and
        displayed within individual classes. School-wide exhibitions or
        interdisciplinary showcases are rare.

      description: >-
        STRUCTURE: Learning areas are scheduled in longer blocks (e.g., 80-90
        minutes), allowing for fewer transitions and more in-depth exploration
        of topics. Blocks may rotate every other day.

        EDUCATOR COLLABORATION: More time for educators to design engaging,
        hands-on activities and incorporate elements of project-based learning
        within their learning areas.

      description: >-
        LEARNER EXPERIENCE: Learners engage more deeply in each learning area
        due to extended class time, though learning areas are still largely
        taught separately.

      description: >-
        INFORMAL LEARNING: Some flexibility is built into longer periods,
        allowing learners to explore topics in greater depth, collaborate on
        projects, or engage in independent work.

        SHOWCASE OF LEARNING: Interdisciplinary projects may be presented in
        class or within small-scale school events, but they remain secondary to
        learning area-based assessment.
