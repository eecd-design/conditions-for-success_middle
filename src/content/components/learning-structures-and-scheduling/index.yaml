        STRUCTURE: The school day is divided into fixed periods (e.g., Period 1:
        Mathematics, Period 2: Science), with each learning area taught in
        isolation. Learners transition between classes based on a rigid
        timetable.

        EDUCATOR COLLABORATION: Minimal interdisciplinary planning. Educators
        focus on individual learning area instruction with limited opportunities
        for cross-curricular connections.
      compass: false
    - tag: 1.3.3
      description: >-
        LEARNER EXPERIENCE: Learners move from one learning area to another
        without explicit connections between content areas. Learning remains
        compartmentalized.

      description: >-
        INFORMAL LEARNING: Limited unstructured time. Informal learning
        primarily occurs in brief recesses, lunch breaks, or before/after
        school.
      compass: false

      description: >-
        SHOWCASE OF LEARNING: Learner achievements are typically assessed and
        displayed within individual classes. School-wide exhibitions or
        interdisciplinary showcases are rare.
