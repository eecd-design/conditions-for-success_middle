Culturally responsive instructional strategies and educators, described by Gloria Ladson Billings as follows:

* **Culturally responsive instructional strategies** ensure space for educators to hold high expectations for learning while recognizing and affirming the strengths that a learner’s lived experiences and/or home culture(s) bring to the learning environment.
* **Culturally responsive educators** focus on learning and academic success and on developing learners’ cultural competence so that all learners can develop positive ethnic and social identities. They support learners’ abilities in recognizing, critiquing and working to change societal inequities.
