        Educators make reference to the Curriculum Framework to identify
        concepts and skills in their assigned subject areas. For example,
        learners read graphs or maps that include numbers but focus on content
        rather than numeracy connections.

        Educators design tasks that are primarily procedural and may lack
        opportunities for deeper learning. Learners are dependent on educators
        to complete tasks and have a fixed mindset. For example, learners follow
        step-by-step lab instructions with little room for inquiry or
        estimation.

        Educators lead class discussions through direct questioning and
        demonstrate how to use specific models. Learners answer direct questions
        and use tools or models only when guided by the educator. For example,
        learners answer educator-led comprehension questions about data in a
        French text but do not generate their own.

        Educators are aware of formative assessment strategies but primarily use
        summative tasks to gather evidence. Feedback is generally focused on
        errors. Learners rely on educators to monitor their progress. For
        example, quizzes and tests are the main form of assessment; feedback
        centers on correct/incorrect answers.

        The Curriculum Framework is referenced and used collaboratively by
        educators to identify relevant concepts and skills in other subject
        areas. Learners are aware of goals, but they are developing the ability
        to connect them to prior learning or other contexts. For example,
        educators connect graphing skills in math to representing data from a
        simple experiment.

        Educators design tasks that promote reasoning and problem solving.
        Learners look for possible entry points to solve problems but are
        frustrated when they are not solved quickly, or mistakes are made. For
        example, learners predict plant growth and compare their estimates to
        real data, learning that approximation is part of scientific reasoning.

        Peer discussions are used to help learners share ideas and build
        understanding. Learners show their thinking in different ways (for
        example, with hands-on materials, pictures, or symbols) when solving
        problems. They actively participate in discussions and choose the method
        that works best for them. For example, learners discuss survey results
        from their class, sharing how they tallied and presented data in French.

        Educators use a mixture of formative and summative assessments to gather
        evidence but rely mostly on products. Feedback offers guidance and is
        also provided by peers. Learners use peer assessment to monitor progress
        but may not independently reflect on their learning. For example,
        learners submit a chart comparing trade routes, with educator feedback
        on accuracy but limited discussion of how the math supported
        understanding.

        The Curriculum Framework is referenced and used collaboratively to
        identify relevant concepts and skills that connect across multiple
        subject areas. Learners can articulate goals, connect them to prior
        learning, and apply them to other contexts. For example, learners read
        an infographic about recycling rates in French and discuss percentages
        using math vocabulary.

        Educators design tasks that promote reasoning and more complex problem
        solving and allow for productive struggle. Learners engage with
        challenging tasks and view mistakes as a valuable part of learning. For
        example, learners design a sustainable community, budgeting costs and
        using reasoning to justify decisions.

        Educators facilitate various learner-led discussions and have them
        explain to others their process and reasoning. Learners generate their
        own questions and independently use a variety of mathematical
        representations. For example, learners examine data sets about climate
        or migration and generate their own “What does this tell us?” questions.

        Educators use evidence gathered daily from a variety of sources
        (observations, conversations, products) to plan and adjust instruction.
        Feedback is clear and specific and offers guidance during the
        instructional process. Learners use self- and peer-assessment to
        independently reflect on and monitor their own progress. For example,
        learners review opinion texts that use statistics to support ideas. The
        educator gives feedback on how data strengthens arguments, and learners
        revise their writing using self-assessment checklists.

        Educators consistently collaborate to connect concepts and skills across
        subject areas and regularly check for readiness with learners. Learners
        can articulate and set their own goals and connect them to a variety of
        contexts. For example, learners identify math goals while designing a
        travel brochure in French (distance, budget, time).

        Educators design tasks that promote reasoning, enable more complex
        problem solving, and allow varied solution strategies. Learners have a
        growth mindset and use self-reflection and critical thinking skills to
        complete tasks and value mistakes. For example, learners compare news
        articles with conflicting statistics, evaluate credibility, and discuss
        how numbers influence readers. They justify conclusions with evidence
        and refine their analysis through peer feedback.

        Learner-led discussions are monitored, with learners explaining or
        challenging the processes and reasoning used. Learners independently
        generate probing analytical questions and use a variety of mathematical
        representations to defend their reasoning. For example, learners debate
        which experimental setup gives the most reliable data, using charts and
        trendlines to defend their position.

        Educators use evidence gathered from a variety of sources during
        instruction to adjust pace and tasks. Feedback is timely, descriptive,
        and specific and encourages reflection. Learners independently set goals
        and use metacognitive strategies to reflect on and monitor their
        progress. For example, after presenting data visualizations, learners
        reflect on how effectively their graph communicated a message and set
        goals for clarity for next time.
