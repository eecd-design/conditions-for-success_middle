        Educators design tasks that are primarily procedural and may lack
        opportunities for deeper learning. Learners are dependent on educators
        to complete tasks and have a fixed mindset about their ability in math.

        Educators lead class discussions through direct questioning and
        demonstrate how to use specific models. Learners answer direct questions
        and use math tools or models only when guided by the educator.

        Educators are aware of formative assessment strategies but primarily use
        summative tasks to gather evidence. Feedback is generally focused on
        errors. Learners rely on educators to monitor their progress.

        The Curriculum Framework is referenced and used collaboratively by
        educators to identify relevant concepts and skills in other subject
        areas. Learners are aware of goals, but they are developing the ability
        to  connect them to prior learning or other contexts.

        Educators design tasks that promote mathematical reasoning and problem
        solving. Learners look for possible entry points to solve problems but
        are frustrated when they are not solved quickly or mistakes are made.

        Peer discussions are used to help learners share ideas and build
        understanding. Learners show their thinking in different ways (for
        example, with hands-on materials, pictures, or symbols) when solving
        problems. They actively participate in discussions and choose the method
        that works best for them.

        Educators use a mixture of formative and summative assessments to gather
        evidence but rely mostly on products. Feedback offers guidance and is
        also provided by peers. Learners use peer assessment to monitor progress
        but may not independently reflect on their learning.

        The Curriculum Framework is referenced and used collaboratively by
        educators to identify relevant concepts and skills that connect across
        multiple subject areas. Learners can articulate goals, connect them to
        prior learning, and apply them to other contexts.

        Educators design tasks that promote mathematical reasoning and more
        complex problem solving and allow for productive struggle. Learners
        engage with challenging tasks and view mistakes as a valuable part of
        learning.

        Educators facilitate various learner-led discussions and have them
        explain to others their process and reasoning. Learners generate their
        own questions and independently use a variety of mathematical
        representations.

        Educators use evidence gathered daily from a variety of sources
        (observations, conversations, products) to plan and adjust instruction.
        Feedback is clear and specific and offers guidance during the
        instructional process. Learners use self- and peer-assessment to
        independently reflect on and monitor their own progress.

        Educators consistently collaborate to connect concepts and skills across
        subject areas and regularly check for readiness with learners. Learners
        can articulate and set their own goals and connect them to a variety of

        Educators design tasks that promote mathematical reasoning, enable more
        complex problem solving, and allow varied solution strategies. Learners
        have a growth mindset and use self-reflection and critical thinking

        Learner-led discussions are monitored, with students explaining or

        generate probing analytical questions and use a variety of mathematical
        representations to defend their reasoning.
