Educators use effective instructional practices including purposeful questions that foster meaningful mathematical discussions and tasks that promote conceptual understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. Educators demonstrate that they believe everyone can learn math and model a positive attitude towards it. Learners use mathematics confidently to solve problems, communicate and reason mathematically, and make connections between mathematics and applications in other relevant contexts.
