        Instruction is primarily remedial, focusing on below-grade-level texts
        and skills. Reading tasks often emphasize filling gaps rather than
        building independence and confidence in literacy.

        Texts are limited to traditional print materials, with little
        recognition of an expanded definition of text (e.g., multimodal texts,
        digital media, spoken word, infographics, visual narratives).

        Expanded definition of text begins to emerge, with educators introducing
        multimodal texts (e.g., podcasts, digital articles, visual storytelling,

        of grade-level material.
