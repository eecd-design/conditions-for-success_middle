        Instruction is primarily remedial, focusing on below-grade-level texts
        and skills. Reading tasks often emphasize filling gaps rather than
        building independence and confidence in literacy.

      description: >-
        Texts are limited to traditional print materials, with little
        recognition of an expanded definition of text (e.g., multimodal texts,
        digital media, spoken word, infographics, visual narratives).

        Expanded definition of text begins to emerge, with educators introducing
        multimodal texts (e.g., podcasts, digital articles, visual storytelling,
        graphic novels) to engage learners, but traditional print-based
        materials still dominate.

        Educators experiment with high-interest, relevant texts to engage
        learners but may still lower text complexity rather than layering
        supports.

        Learners begin using digital tools and assistive technologies (e.g.,

        Many learners read grade-level texts with structured scaffolds (e.g.,
        frontloading vocabulary, mixed ability groupings, guided annotation,
        modeling complex comprehension strategies).

        Expanded definition of text is fully embedded, with learners engaging in
        a variety of text types (e.g., documentary clips, professional writing,
        social media discourse, primary source visuals) to support comprehension
        of grade-level material.

        Educators routinely analyze learner work and progress data to adjust
        scaffolds rather than lower text complexity.
