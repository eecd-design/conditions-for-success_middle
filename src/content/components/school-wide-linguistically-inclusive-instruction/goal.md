Classroom educators understand their role as educators of the language of their learning area within an established structure of support for learners who are learning language and content in the school. Learners have entry points to participate in each class, available because of linguistic scaffolding provided by the educator, and a sense of belonging and safety that has been carefully co-constructed by the educator and learner. To supplement the other high-yield instructional practices that are being employed, educators use linguistic scaffolds that enable participation and provide opportunity for achievement of all learners, including those still acquiring the language.
