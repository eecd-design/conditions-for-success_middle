        Educators begin to discuss the rationale for differentiation. They use
        minimal grouping or “one-size-fits-all” lessons with some basic attempts
        at individualized strategies (e.g., extra worksheets for advanced
        learners).

        Most learners receive the same tasks; few adaptations are evident for
        learners with different readiness levels.

        Educators begin to differentiate by adjusting content (e.g., text
        complexity), process (e.g., choice of learning activities), or product
        (e.g., varied project formats). Some use flexible grouping based on
        pre-assessment data.

        Learners are given options or leveled tasks (e.g., striving readers
        receive scaffolded texts, advanced learners may explore deeper or
        extended tasks).

        Differentiation becomes routine, with consistent use of ongoing
        assessments to regroup learners and tailor instruction. Educators
        thoughtfully align adaptations to Skill Descriptors and Achievement
        Indicators and learner needs.

        Learners frequently select from multiple pathways (e.g., learning
        centers, interactive tasks, peer teaching) that address their readiness,

        Grade-level or learning area (e.g., English Language Arts) teams

        Differentiation is embedded in every lesson, supported by data-driven
        adjustments, co-teaching models, and robust professional learning.
        Educators also mentor newer staff in differentiation practices.
